History of severe allergy/hypersensitivity or ongoing clinically important allergy/hypersensitivity as judged by the investigator.\n24. Whole blood or red blood cell donation, or any blood loss \\> 500 mL (or \\> 400 mL in Part D) during the 3 months prior to screening.\n25. History of psychosis or bipolar disorder.\n26.

Received another new chemical entity (defined as a compound that has not been approved for marketing), or has participated in any other clinical study that included drug treatment within at least 30 days or 5 half-lives prior to the first administration of study intervention in this study (whichever is longer). The period of exclusion to begin 30 days or 5 halflives of IMP after the final dose, or after the last visit, whichever is longest. Participants consented and screened, but not randomised into this study or a previous Phase 1 study, are not excluded.\n30. History of lactic acidosis\n31. Use of any of the following medicinal products:\n\n    * Use of systemic corticosteroids within 28 days prior to screening.\n    * Use of compounds known to prolong the QTc interval.\n    * Use of any herbal preparations or medicinal products licensed for control of body weight or appetite within 3 months prior to screening.\n32. Use of drugs with enzyme inducing properties such as St John's Wort within 3 weeks prior to the first administration of study intervention.\n33. Received another new chemical entity (defined as a compound that has not been approved for marketing), or has participated in any other clinical study that included drug treatment within at least 30 days or 5 half-lives prior to the first administration of study intervention in this study (whichever is longer). The period of exclusion to begin 30 days or 5 half-lives of IMP after the final dose, or after the last visit, whichever is longest. Participants consented and screened, but not randomised into this study or previous AZD9550, AZD6234, or AZD9550/AZD6234 combination studies, are not excluded from Part E.\n34. Previous enrolment or randomisation in the present study.\n35. Concurrent participation in another study of any kind is prohibited.\n36. Ongoing weight loss diet (hypocaloric diet) or use of weight loss agents, unless the diet or treatment has been stopped at least 3 months prior to screening and the participant has had a stable body weight (± 5%) during the 3 months prior to screening.\n37. Participants who are vegans, ones with medical dietary restrictions, or participants who are willingly conducting any diet likely to increase ketone levels (Atkins or any similar diet based on increased protein consummation or low carbohydrate content) (Part A-D only).\n38. Excessive intake of caffeine-containing drinks or food (eg, coffee, tea, Coca-Cola/Pepsi or similar drink type, chocolate) as judged by the investigator (Part A-D only).\n39. Current smokers or those who have smoked or used nicotine products (including e-cigarettes) within the previous 3 months prior to screening (Part A-D only).\n40. Participants who cannot communicate reliably with the investigator or vulnerable participants (eg, kept in detention, protected adults under guardianship, trusteeship, or committed to an institution by governmental or juridical order).\n41. The participant is an employee, or close relative of an employee, of AstraZeneca, the CRO, or the study site, regardless of the employee's role.\n42. Judgement by the investigator that the participant should not participate in the study if the participant is unlikely to comply with study procedures, restrictions, and requirements.\n43. Contra-indication to MRI: such as participants with pacemakers, metallic cardiac valves, magnetic material such as surgical clips, implanted electronic infusion pumps or other conditions that would preclude proximity to a strong magnetic field; participants with history of extreme claustrophobia or participant cannot fit inside the MRI scanner cavity (Parts B and C only).\n44.
