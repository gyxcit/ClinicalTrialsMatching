The investigators will also determine how the parasite grows in humans, and the effect of anti-malarial drugs.\n\nResearchers will use a controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) model to infect participants with malaria to observe the development of the disease, collect malaria-infected blood, and then treat the participants to cure the malaria infection.\n\nThe collected malaria-infected blood will be used to create a frozen stock of malaria parasites for use in future research.', 'detailedDescription': 'Malaria is caused by the Plasmodium parasite and is spread through the bite of mosquitos. During the blood stage of a malaria infection, the parasite can be found in four different forms. Most antimalarial drugs effectively kill the parasites, however, they do not kill one form of the parasite known as gametocytes. Gametocytes are important in the spread of malaria as they are the only form which can be passed from human back to a mosquito.\n\nCurrently, primaquine (an antimalarial drug) is the only medicine which kills gametocytes. However, this cannot be given to everyone. Individuals with certain genetic and metabolic disorders, including glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, face severe health risks if they take Primaquine. Testing for G6PD deficiency is expensive and not available worldwide, which further reduces the number of individuals who can safely take this medication. Therefore, researchers need to develop new antimalarial drugs which kill gametocytes that are safe for all people.\n\nDeveloping an improved controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) model which produces more gametocytes is a crucial step in advancing antimalarial research, especially targeting the transmission stage. To achieve this, the investigators have created a laboratory made genetically modified (change in DNA), malaria parasite known as Plasmodium falciparum NF54/iGP3, which makes an increased number of gametocytes in comparison with naturally occurring malaria parasites.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to develop a CHMI with NF54/iGP3 genetically altered parasites to assess the safety of infecting humans with this malaria parasite as well as determine the growth of the malaria parasites in humans and the effect of anti-malarial drugs. Samples from this study will be used to create a master cell bank of the NF54/iGP3 parasite, so that future research can be carried out using a malaria blood-stage infection model that will produce a greater proportion of gametocytes during infection.\n\nThe importance of this research is crucial for the future development and testing of new treatments and vaccines against malarial gametocytes. The development of new antimalarial drugs against malarial gametocytes will over time prevent malaria being transmitted from humans to mosquitos ultimately eliminating the continual spread of malaria.'}, 'conditionsModule': {'conditions': ['Malaria Falciparum', 'Malaria Infection', 'Malaria Transmission'], 'keywords': ['SWITCH', 'NF54/iGP3', 'Plasmodium falciparum']}, 'designModule': {'studyType': 'INTERVENTIONAL', 'phases': ['PHASE1'], 'designInfo': {'allocation': 'NA', 'interventionModel': 'SINGLE_GROUP', 'interventionModelDescription': 'All participants enrolled into the study will be infected with the malaria parasite.', 'primaryPurpose': 'OTHER', 'maskingInfo': {'masking': 'NONE'}}, 'enrollmentInfo': {'count': 2, 'type': 'ESTIMATED'}}, 'armsInterventionsModule': {'armGroups': [{'label': 'Plasmodium falciparum NF54/iGP3', 'type': 'EXPERIMENTAL', 'description': 'Infection by direct feeding of Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes infected with Plasmodium falciparum NF54/iGP3', 'interventionNames': ['Biological: NF54/iGP3']}], 'interventions': [{'type': 'BIOLOGICAL', 'name': 'NF54/iGP3', 'description': 'Mosquito-generated sporozoites of the genetically modified, inducible gametocyte-producing parasite line NF54/iGP3, created via CRISPR/Cas9 genetic engineering of the parental wildtype strain Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) NF54 to contain a trimethoprim (TMP)-inducible copy of the Pf gdv1 gene in the dispensable Pf cg6 locus.', 'armGroupLabels': ['Plasmodium falciparum NF54/iGP3']}]}, 'outcomesModule': {'primaryOutcomes': [{'measure': 'To assess the infectivity, safety and tolerability of mosquito bite sporozoite challenge with NF54/iGP3 in healthy malaria-naïve participants by counting solicited and unsolicited adverse events.', 'description': 'Count the occurrence and assess the severity of local and systemic, solicited and unsolicited adverse events using CTCAE v5.0, following administration of NF54/iGP3 by mosquito bite.', 'timeFrame': 'From Inoculation (Day 1) until End of Study (Day 180)'}], 'secondaryOutcomes': [{'measure': 'To characterise the parasite growth profile of all blood stage parasites in participants following infection with NF54/iGP3 using qPCR (parasites/mL).', 'description': 'Measure the change in parasite count (parasites/mL) of blood-stage NF54/iGP3 parasites via qPCR, following inoculation until the administration of antimalarial treatment.', 'timeFrame': 'From Inoculation (Day 1) until conditions for treatment are met (truncated at Day 22)'}, {'measure': 'To characterise the post-treatment clearance profile of all blood stage parasites in participants following infection with NF54/iGP3 using qPCR (parasites/mL).', 'description': 'Measure the change in parasite count (parasites/mL) of blood-stage NF54/iGP3 parasites via qPCR, following administration of registered schizonticidal and gametocidal antimalarial treatments.', 'timeFrame': 'From administration of antimalarial treatment until End of Study (Day 180)'}, {'measure': ""Measure the parasite count (parasites/mL) using qPCR in the participant's blood at the time of large volume blood withdrawal."", 'description': 'Measure the parasite count (parasites/mL) via qPCR in collected blood samples from study participants infected with NF54/iGP3, to determine the level of parasitemia.', 'timeFrame': 'From Inoculation (Day 1) until parasitemia conditions are met, truncated at Day 22'}]}, 'eligibilityModule': {'eligibilityCriteria': ""INCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\n* Able and willing to complete the informed consent process\n* Available for the entire planned study duration\n* Male or Female\n* Aged 18 to 55 years\n* Willing to have blood samples collected, stored indefinitely and used for research purposes\n* Willing to defer blood donations for at least six months after the EoS visit (D180)\n* Agreement to adhere to specific Lifestyle Considerations throughout study duration\n\nClinical Criteria:\n\n* Total body weight ≥ 50 kg, and a body mass index (BMI) within the range of 18 to 32 kg/m2 (inclusive)\n* In good general physical and mental health as evaluated through a comprehensive clinical assessment\n* Vital signs at screening and pre-inoculation within normal clinical range\n* Electrocardiograph (ECG) without significant abnormalities, including: QTcF ≤450 ms for males, QTcF ≤470 ms for females, PR interval ≤210 ms\n\nLaboratory Criteria:\n\n* O negative blood type\n* Haemoglobin, white cell count and platelet levels within normal laboratory ranges\n* Ferritin, creatinine and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) within normal laboratory ranges\n* No clinically significant abnormality in coagulation or clotting\n* Normal G6PD enzyme activity levels as defined by the parameters of the specific quantitative G6PD test performed at screening\n* Negative for blood borne viruses, including Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Hepatitis B virus (HBV), Hepatitis C virus (HCV), Human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV);

It is caused by germs that are spread by mosquito bites. It can be fatal if not diagnosed and treated right away. Children younger than 5 and pregnant women are most at risk to get malaria. Researchers want to create a vaccine that will prevent malaria infection during pregnancy.\n\nObjectives:\n\n\\- To create a vaccine that will prevent malaria infection during pregnancy. To assess possible vaccines using in-vitro tests with parasites taken from pregnant women.\n\nEligibility:\n\n\\- Pregnant women ages 15-25\n\nDesign:\n\n* The study site is an area in Mali, West Africa.\n* Participants:\n* Will have blood drawn.\n* Will give consent for the blood sample to be used for future research.\n* May have a physical exam.\n* Participants who have malaria or anemia will get treatment.', 'detailedDescription': 'Malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum continues to be a global problem with devastating consequences. Pregnancy malaria is associated with low birth weight (LBW), maternal anemia, and gestational hypertension; and both inflammation and the fetal response to infection may contribute to these poor outcomes. Pregnancy malaria (PM) is caused by P. falciparum-infected erythrocytes that bind to the placental receptor chondroitin sulfate A (CSA) and sequester in the placenta, where they cause disease and death for the mother and her offspring. Women become resistant to pregnancy malaria as they acquire antibodies that target surface proteins of placental parasites. Malaria vaccine candidates targeting the parasite s liver stage or blood stage may not protect pregnant women and their unborn children. The primary hypothesis in this study is that antibodies raised in animals against recombinant pregnancy malaria vaccine candidates will have a similar functional activity as naturally acquired antibodies. Up to 2492 malaria-infected pregnant women will be recruited into a cross sectional study that will be conducted in Ouelessebougou and neighboring districts, Mali. Women presenting for antenatal visit at the health centers in Ouelessebougou District will be enrolled. Samples collected from the women will be used in in-vitro assays to assess the functional activity of immunoglobulin G (IgG) raised against pregnancy malaria vaccine candidates as the primary outcome of this study. For our secondary outcomes, we will examine functional activity of naturally acquired antibodies specific to the vaccine candidates. Functional activity by IgG to vaccine candidates will be compared to the activity obtained with control proteins using appropriate statistical methods, including adjustment for possible confounders such as parasite density in the assay, to determine if the candidates elicit the type of immune response observed in naturally exposed population.'}, 'conditionsModule': {'conditions': ['Malaria'], 'keywords': ['Assays', 'Women', 'Infected', 'Antibodies', 'Plasmodium Falciparum', 'Natural History']}, 'designModule': {'studyType': 'OBSERVATIONAL', 'designInfo': {'observationalModel': 'CASE_ONLY', 'timePerspective': 'CROSS_SECTIONAL'}, 'enrollmentInfo': {'count': 7476, 'type': 'ESTIMATED'}}, 'armsInterventionsModule': {'armGroups': [{'label': 'Pregnant Women 15-25 years old', 'description': 'Malaria-infected pregnant Women'}]}, 'outcomesModule': {'primaryOutcomes': [{'measure': 'Measure of functional activity of animal IgG against vaccine candidates to block binding of fresh pregnancy malaria isolates to the placental receptor CSA', 'timeFrame': 'Approximately 1 year'}]}, 'eligibilityModule': {'eligibilityCriteria': '* INCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\nA study participant must satisfy the following criteria to be enrolled in this study:\n\n* Pregnant women aged 15-25 years\n* Able to provide consent for self\n* Malaria positive by rapid diagnostic test (RDT)\n\nEXCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\n* Severe anemia defined as HGB\\<7 gr/dL, that may be worsened by 10 mL phlebotomy\n* Conditions that in the judgment of the investigator could increase the risk to the volunteer\n* Prior enrollment to the study during the same pregnancy', 'healthyVolunteers': True, 'sex': 'FEMALE', 'minimumAge': '15 Years', 'maximumAge': '25 Years', 'stdAges': ['CHILD', 'ADULT'], 'studyPopulation': 'Pregnant women age 15-25 years presenting for antenatal consultations or delivery at health centers or hospital in Ouelessebougou and neighboring districts@@@@@@', 'samplingMethod': 'NON_PROBABILITY_SAMPLE'}, 'contactsLocationsModule': {'centralContacts': [{'name': 'Michal Fried, Ph.D.', 'role': 'CONTACT', 'phone': '(240) 747-7880', 'email': 'michal.fried@nih.gov'}], 'overallOfficials': [{'name': 'Michal Fried, Ph.D.', 'affiliation': 'National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)', 'role': 'PRINCIPAL_INVESTIGATOR'}], 'locations': [{'facility': 'Ouelessebougou Clinical Research Center', 'status': 'RECRUITING', 'city': 'Bamako', 'country': 'Mali', 'contacts': [{'name': 'Almahamoudou Mahamar', 'role': 'CONTACT', 'phone': '(223) 762-3250', 'email': 'almahamar@icermali.org'}], 'geoPoint': {'lat': 12.60915, 'lon': -7.97522}}]}, 'referencesModule': {'references': [{'pmid': '9804416', 'type': 'BACKGROUND', 'citation': 'Fried M, Nosten F, Brockman A, Brabin BJ, Duffy PE.

The primary purpose of the study is to provide evidence of the impact of PMC on malaria burden and related clinical outcomes, and its operational feasibility for policy decision and the inclusion of PMC into upcoming programme and funding cycles for its National Malaria Control Strategic Plan. The objectives are:\n\n1. To evaluate the impact of PMC in children aged 2-18 months on key child health outcomes including malaria burden, hospitalisations, and anaemia.\n2. To describe indicators of operational feasibility of PMC by identification and measurement of key determinants of successful uptake and implementation of PMC.', 'detailedDescription': ""Study Design and Procedures The impact of PMC will be evaluated in a two-arm cluster-randomised controlled trial and nested case control study. The primary impact outcomes are a comparison of the incidence of clinical malaria in children 2-18 months of age visiting selected sentinel primary care facilities in intervention arm and comparison (standard care) arm wards in the study site, and the protective effectiveness of SP in the 28 days following a dose in intervention arm wards. A ward, the lowest level of health services administration for the State, will be the cluster unit of randomisation. A single facility meeting study eligibility criteria will be selected in each ward as the sentinel facility in which study outcomes will be evaluated (bi-monthly extraction of data on confirmed malaria cases by the study team). Strengthened age recording (full age in months) of visiting children will be implemented in each sentinel facility. An identical programme of data collection will take place in secondary and tertiary hospitals which serve the study site and will include data on admissions of children with an address in a study ward.\n\nCross sectional household 'malariometric' surveys will be conducted in catchment area communities of ;in both arms at baseline, at 18 months following start of PMC implementation, and at 24 months once implementation ends. Data on coverage of PMC doses (main indicator of feasibility) will be collected from child health record cards or caregiver report for children in the age groups eligible to receive the doses in question. Additional data on malaria infection (RDT test) and anaemia prevalence will be collected during the cross sectional surveys.\n\nCollection of malaria data from sentinel facilities for children aged 19 months and older who were eligible to receive PMC during the implementation period (but too old at the end of implementation) will continue for an additional 12 months following the end of implementation period. The potential rebound effects of the intervention will be assessed in this period by a comparison of incidence rates in control and intervention arm wards.\n\nSample size (impact): The expected reduction in incidence of malaria in children aged 2-18 months after 18 months of implementation is conservatively estimated to be between 18%-32% contingent on the level of coverage of PMC doses in the intervention arm; enrolling 40 wards in each arm (for a total of 80) will provide 90% power to detect an impact of 20% in this age group after 18 months of implementation, and 95% after 24 months of implementation. We will also recruit children aged 2-18m with clinical malaria from 8 of the 40 intervention arm sentinel facilities and match these to 2-4 controls to have 95% power to detect a protective effectiveness of 50% reduction in malaria in the 28 days following a dose of SP.\n\nSample size (feasibility): To estimate coverage for any dose of 50% with a margin of error of 8%, assuming a design effect of 2.44 based on an implied intra cluster correlation coefficient of 0.18 (Nigeria DHS) to account for the cluster sample strategy, and allowing for 10% non-response, 25 children aged 2-36 months will be required in each cluster (ward), for a total of 25x40=1,000 in each arm of the study and with a total of 2000 across both arms.\n\nFollow-up period: The total follow-up period of implementation will be 24 months, starting April 2023 to March 2025. The primary evaluation of impact and feasibility will occur in the first 18 months of implementation (April 2023 - September 2024).\n\nDescription of intervention: Health facility staff will be trained to offer scheduled doses of SP linked to the EPI delivery platform in children aged 10 weeks to 15 months (six doses), plus additional 'pragmatic' monthly doses offered outside of the EPI schedule to children up to 18 months of age (up to eleven additional doses). Additional social mobilisation and social behaviour change (SBC) activities will be conducted throughout the implementation period to increase demand and uptake of vaccination and PMC services in the study population.\n\nPharmacovigilance: Spontaneous (passive) adverse event (AE) reporting will be implemented in all study facilities (both sentinel and non-sentinel facilities in study wards),and will include training of health facility staff to recognise and manage known potential side effects of SP, and the development of picture based AE cards and posters for families and facility staff. Children with severe AEs will be referred to secondary/tertiary facilities as appropriate. A programme of active AE monitoring in a cohort of children will be additionally implemented in 2 facilities in each intervention arm in order to collect more detailed data on timings and symptoms following PMC or EPI doses, and to compare AE reporting rates between arms.\n\nAdditional activities: Cross-sectional health facility surveys and stakeholder interviews will take place during the follow-up period to collect data on implementation outcomes, alongside qualitative data collection in focus group discussions and in-depth interviews.""}, 'conditionsModule': {'conditions': ['Malaria'], 'keywords': ['PMC', 'Chemoprevention', 'Malaria', 'Integrated delivery']}, 'designModule': {'studyType': 'INTERVENTIONAL', 'phases': ['NA'], 'designInfo': {'allocation': 'RANDOMIZED', 'interventionModel': 'PARALLEL', 'interventionModelDescription': 'The intervention arm will comprise PMC-plus: A 6-scheduled dose regimen administered to eligible children at 10 weeks, 14 weeks, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months and 15 months of age concurrently with EPI vaccinations DTP2/Penta2, DTP3/Penta3, vitamin A, and measles immunisation where appropriate.

The therapeutic restriction of PQ/TQ use in lactating women during the first six months postpartum effectively translates into \\~10% of females being excluded from radical cure in endemic areas at any time. This is because many at risk women live in remote areas, are frequently lost to follow-up, or may have conceived again before they reattend. As a result, radical cure is rarely achieved and women are exposed to recurrent infections and cumulative risk of anaemia. Relapses may occur for years, placing subsequent pregnancies at risk and perpetuating intergenerational failure of fetal growth. They also contribute to malaria transmission, thus household and community exposure to vivax malaria.\n\nThe goal of the present study is to determine how much PQ/TQ is transferred to a suckling baby, if a mother receives a treatment course of PQ/TQ at time of delivery. We also want to confirm that this treatment is safe and has no major side effects for babies in Papua New Guinea.\n\nThe study Interventions areas follows: Group 1 - Participants receive PNG standard of care; PQ given 6-months postpartum; Group 2 - Participants receive a 14-day treatment regimen of PQ, at the standard dose prescribed in PNG for vivax radical cure (0.5 mg/kg/day for 14 days); Group 3 - Participants receive an accelerated high-dose 7-day treatment regimen of PQ, as per current WHO recommendations (1.0 mg/kg/day for 7 days); Group 4 - Participants receive a single dose of 300mg tafenoquine.\n\nAll participants will be monitored for a total duration of 6 months, with the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary relapse efficacy of PQ/TQ evaluated at standardised time points over this period (Day 0, 1, 3, 6, 8, 15, 20, 28, and Month 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6). At each of these time points, participants will be asked to describe any symptoms they may be experiencing, participate in a medical examination, and provide a blood and breast milk sample for drug analysis and safety (biochemistry and haematology testing). The investigators will also collect a small blood sample (heel prick) from the infant to measure drug concentrations and safety testing.', 'detailedDescription': ""Global malaria eradication requires universal and equitable access to effective antimalarial treatment. More than 2.5 billion people are at risk of infection with Plasmodium vivax. Unlike falciparum malaria, P. vivax forms dormant liver-stage parasites (hypnozoites) that can reactivate (relapse) causing recurrent febrile illness after the initial infection. Women are at increased risk of vivax malaria during pregnancy and postpartum, when they are at higher risk of P. vivax infections than P. falciparum malaria. Over 80% of these infections are relapses, rather than new infections but pregnant and lactating women cannot be treated with the available anti-relapse drugs. This is because the 8-aminoquinolones, primaquine (PQ) and tafenoquine (TQ), can cause potentially life-threatening haemolysis in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD)-deficient babies, and there is concern that the drugs are transferred in breast milk. If anti-relapse treatment could be given immediately on delivery and before discharge, it would dramatically reduce the risk of vivax relapses which currently affect \\~10% of women in countries like Papua New Guinea (PNG).\n\nThis study aims to accelerate maternal access to PQ/TQ by confirming minimal transfer of PQ or TQ not only in mature breast milk (\\>2 weeks postpartum; current data available from a pharmacokinetic (PK) study in Thailand), but also in colostrum and transitional breast milk in the first two weeks after birth. Generating PK data for TQ is also critical. Maternal treatment could then be initiated before hospital discharge to prevent postpartum relapses and maximise benefit for health outcomes and malaria control.\n\nThis open-label study has the following objectives and hypothesis:\n\nPrimary Objective: To determine the transfer of primaquine (and primary metabolite carboxyprimaquine) and tafenoquine in breast milk (colostrum and transitional milk) and determine associated relative infant exposure.\n\nSecondary objectives include; i) To compare haematological and hepatorenal indices in exposed and unexposed mother-infant pairs as a measure of safety, and ii) to assess maternal tolerability of early postpartum primaquine (PQ) and tafenoquine (TQ) treatment.\n\nHypothesis: i) Negligible concentrations of PQ and TQ will be detected in colostrum and transitional milk, or breastfed infants, when mothers are treated with PQ or TQ and ii) Maternal administration of therapeutic doses of PQ or TQ immediately after birth does not result in clinically significant haematological or hepatorenal changes in breastfed neonates.\n\nTo do this, once eligibility is confirmed, and appropriate informed consent obtained, a sample of 60 postpartum mother-infant pairs will be recruited into one of four study treatment groups (n=15 per treatment group).\n\nDue to the nature of the research, a conservative approach will be taken to treatment allocation, with groups (n=15) of participants to be allocated treatment doses in a stepwise design as follows: Group 1 - non-intervention (control) group; Group 2 - PQ14 (0.5 mg/kg/day for 14 days); Group 3 - PQ7 (1 mg/kg/day for 7 days); and Group 4 - TQ (300 mg single dose).\n\nReview of mother and neonate for safety and PK procedures across all groups will be scheduled on days 0, 1, 3, 6, 8, 15, 20 and 28 (and 56 for Group 4). At each scheduled time point a symptom questionnaire (capturing both maternal symptoms and the mother's observations of her child) will be conducted, along with a physical examination of both mother and infant. Samples for PK (maternal venous blood, maternal dried blood spot, fore- and hind-breast milk, infant dried blood spot) and safety assessment (haemoglobin, methaemoglobin, hepatorenal biochemistry) will also be collected at specified time points to confirm safety and characterise the transfer and PK profile of PQ/TQ in breast milk and associated infant exposure.\n\nAfter completion of procedures (Day 28 for Groups 1-3 and Day 59 for Group 4) standardized review of each mother and infant will be conducted monthly for 6 months after initial treatment to monitor P. vivax recurrence and other indicators of maternal and infant health. These study review visits will be timed to coincide with the national infant immunisation schedule at 1, 2, 3 and 6 months. Examination of the infant by study staff will complement assessment of developmental milestones, and maternal assessment could include family planning.""}, 'conditionsModule': {'conditions': ['Drug Pharmacokinetics in Healthy Volunteers'], 'keywords': ['primaquine', 'tafenoquine', 'vivax malaria', 'pharmacokinetics', 'postpartum', 'lactation', 'infant exposure']}, 'designModule': {'studyType': 'INTERVENTIONAL', 'phases': ['PHASE2', 'PHASE3'], 'designInfo': {'allocation': 'NON_RANDOMIZED', 'interventionModel': 'SEQUENTIAL', 'primaryPurpose': 'OTHER', 'maskingInfo': {'masking': 'NONE'}}, 'enrollmentInfo': {'count': 60, 'type': 'ESTIMATED'}}, 'armsInterventionsModule': {'armGroups': [{'label': 'Group1 - control', 'type': 'NO_INTERVENTION', 'description': 'Participants will receive no intervention at time of delivery.

To assess the safety and tolerability of R21 through spontaneously reported adverse events.\n2. To compare in intervention and control clusters the incidence of malaria infection (all age groups) during the malaria transmission season following seasonal mass vaccination with R21 (3 monthly doses).\n3.
