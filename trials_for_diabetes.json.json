          "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to find out if phone call and video-based interventions that seek to educate people with uncontrolled high blood pressure and also remind them to take their medicines will improve adherence to their medicines. It will also examine if the interventions are economical to implement. The main objectives of the study are:\n\n* Design videos and phone call-based interventions for people with hypertension.\n* Examine the effect of videos and phone call-based intervention on adherence to medication in people with hypertension.\n* Calculate the costs associated with the mobile health intervention\n* Examine the factors influencing acceptance of video and phone calls based interventions for improving adherence to antihypertensive medications among patients\n\nParticipants will:\n\n* Receive the intervention thrice weekly for 3 months\n* Visit the health facility at the end of 3 months for check up and measurement of outcome variables (adherence and blood pressure). Additionally, at the end of 3 months, the acceptability of the interventions will be measured among the participants who received either phone call or video.\n\nResearchers will compare the two groups (one group will utilize phone call whereas the other videos) with the control group to see if the mobile interventions improve adherence to medicines. Only adults 18 years and above in selected health facilities in the Eastern will participate in the study. The selected participants should have uncontrolled blood pressure based on readings from last 2 visits. To be included in the study, the participants need to own a smartphone.",
          "detailedDescription": "Hypertension prevalence in adults ranges between 19 percent and 55 percent in Ghana (Agongo et al., 2020). About half of the patients diagnosed with hypertension in Ghana exhibit signs of organ damage which occur as a result of poor control of blood pressure and late detection by the health system (Atibila et al., 2021). Despite the availability of effective treatment regimen and evidence of benefits of treatment, hypertension remains poorly controlled in Ghana as studies have reported control rates ranging from 24 percent to 42 percent (Sanuade et al., 2018).\n\nThe high prevalence of uncontrolled blood pressure has been attributed mainly to poor medication adherence (Boima et al., 2015). A study conducted by Abeasi et al. (2022) in the Upper East region indicated that about 60 percent of hypertensive patients were nonadherent to their medications. Also, another study (Adomako et al., 2021) reported non-adherence rates of 49 percent and 53 percent in two hospitals in the Ashanti region. These high rates of nonadherence thwart the efforts to control and manage hypertension.\n\nWith the increase in availability and uptake of mobile phones worldwide, mobile health technologies (mHealth) have been identified as promising strategies that can be used to remind, motivate and educate patients about their disease as well as medications to improve adherence to medications in patients with hypertension (Anglada-Martinez et al., 2015; Xiong et al., 2018). Ghana has the highest mobile penetration rate in Africa (Global System for Mobile Communications Association (GSMA), 2020) and as of 2021, there were over 40 million mobile connections in the country (Kemp, 2021). The widespread use of mobile phones provides a unique opportunity for clinicians to leverage mHealth to improve medication adherence as they are incorporated widely into daily life.\n\nStudies that have utilized mHealth interventions to improve adherence to antihypertensive medications have mostly employed short message service (SMS)(Buis et al., 2017; Leon et al., 2015; Maslakpak \\& Safaie, 2016; Sartori et al., 2020; Varleta et al., 2017). The challenge with text messaging or SMS is that it is difficult to apply to every context, especially in Africa where the literacy level is reported to be low (Gee et al., 2015). Also, evidence suggests that individuals with lower levels of education may not open and read the messages (Saleh et al., 2018). There is also the likelihood that people may read the messages and may not understand them (Sartori et al., 2020). Additionally, text messaging restricts the number of characters that can be sent and hence, messages sent may lack details which makes them difficult to be understood (Schoenthaler et al., 2020). Other authors have noted that the content of the messages may become monotonous resulting in message fatigue and possible withdrawal from the study (Finitsis et al., 2014; Horner et al., 2017).\n\nOther equally important alternatives such as phone calls and videos can overcome most of the challenges associated with SMS (Asante et al., 2020; Stanczyk et al., 2016). Existing evidence from the healthcare literature suggests that videos perform better than written words since words cannot convey facial expressions and body language (Schooley et al., 2015). Again the use of videos is useful for individuals who have less education, health literacy and motivation to take medicines as it does not necessitate extensive reading of numerous pages of written material (Ben-Zeev et al., 2018). The use of phone call based interventions also increases patients confidence in the information provided and allows them to receive immediate feedback on queries about their illness or medications (Son et al., 2020). There is a paucity of studies on use of phone call and video-based interventions in improving adherence to medications in hypertensive patients in the mHealth literature (Chun-Yun Kang, 2022).\n\nFurther, most mHealth studies have focused mostly on the design and implementation of the interventions as well as examining the effectiveness of the interventions. However, it is important to understand the costs incurred for the effectiveness achieved to ascertain value of investing in the technology (Hamine et al., 2015; Rehman et al., 2017; Varleta et al., 2017). Data on the cost-effectiveness of mHealth interventions are predominantly unavailable in developing countries (Majumdar et al., 2015; Stephani et al., 2016). The economic evaluation of mobile health interventions is imperative as it helps policymakers to make decisions that ensure better resource allocation.\n\nIn Ghana, a dearth of literature exists on randomized controlled trials examining the effectiveness of mobile health interventions in improving treatment adherence in hypertensive patients. Existing studies have focused on examining the usage of smartphone applications to improve blood pressure control among stroke patients (Sarfo et al., 2019) and barriers, facilitators as well as recommended mHealth strategies to manage hypertension in patients who have recovered from stroke (Nichols et al., 2017). None of these studies considered the general hypertensive patients who can escape the possibility of experiencing stroke when they adhere to their medications and also, none utilized phone calls and video-based interventions.\n\nAdditionally, most of the mHealth studies conclude with evaluation of effectiveness of the interventions without exploring the reasons behind the results. Nonetheless, it is important to understand why the intervention is effective or not to guide future intervention development and also possible scale-up. In the context of technology, the effectiveness is likely dependent on the acceptability of the intervention by the target population which influences usage (AlSwayied et al., 2022; Sekhon et al., 2017). Very little is known about the acceptability and determinants of acceptance of mHealth interventions for the management of chronic non-communicable diseases including hypertension in developing countries (Déglise et al., 2012; Majumdar et al., 2015).\n\nThis study aims to fill the gaps in the literature by examining the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and acceptability of video and phone call interventions in improving adherence to antihypertensive medications in Ghana using a randomized controlled trial.\n\nSpecifically, the study seeks to:\n\nI. Design videos and phone calls-based interventions for hypertensive patients. II. Examine the effect of videos and phone call-based intervention on adherence to medication in hypertensive patients.\n\nIII. Examine the cost-effectiveness of phone call and video-based interventions in improving adherence to medications in hypertensive patients IV. Examine the factors influencing acceptance of video and phone calls-based interventions for improving adherence to antihypertensive medications among patients.\n\nResearch Questions I. Do phone calls and video-based interventions improve adherence to antihypertensive medications? II. What is the cost-effectiveness of mobile health interventions (phone calls and videos) in improving adherence to antihypertensive medications?\n\nIII. What are the factors influencing the acceptance of video and phone calls-based interventions to improve adherence to medications in hypertensive patients?\n\nStudy Design A three-armed parallel cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) design will be utilized for the study with participants recruited from health facilities. One group will be randomized to receive phone calls in addition to care as usual. The second group will receive videos as well as usual care whereas the control group will receive usual care only. Randomisation by health facilities is chosen to evade potential contamination that could result when individual randomization is adopted. Participants will be recruited over a period of 60 days until the required number has been achieved. The interventions will be administered for a period of 3 months.\n\nStudy setting The health facilities for the study will be selected from the Eastern Region. Eastern Region is chosen for the study because it had the highest prevalence of hypertension in 2022 according to the data received from the Ghana Health Service.\n\nAccording to the 2021 Population and Housing Census (PHC), Eastern region has 33 districts and a total population of 2,925,653. About 49 percent of the total population are males whilst the remaining are females(Ghana Statistical Service, 2021). The main ethnic groups in the region are Akan, Ewe, Ga-Adangbe and Guan (Ghana Statistical Service, 2013). The major religious group in the region is Christianity with fewer inhabitants belonging to the Islamic and traditional religions. There are also a few others who do not belong to any religion (Ghana Statistical Service, 2013). Approximately 45 percent of the population aged 12 years and over own a mobile phone and ownership in the region is largely urban(Ghana Statistical Service, 2013).\n\nStudy Participants and Recruitment The eligibility criteria for all phases of the study include 1) adult aged 18 years or older 2) diagnosed of hypertension 3) has uncontrolled hypertension (i.e. systolic blood pressure ≥140 mmHg and a diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90mmHg) documented in their records on 2 clinic visits 4) has been prescribed at least one antihypertensive medication for a period of 2 months before the study 5) owns a smart phone or has access to one at all times.\n\nThe exclusion criteria for the study include 1) Pregnant women with hypertension or within 3 months postpartum 2) Hypertensive patients with diabetes, liver failure or kidney disease 3) Plans to travel out of the country during the period of the study 4) Participating in another mobile health intervention or medication adherence intervention 5) has a psychiatric disease or mental illness 6) has a visual impairment.\n\nHealthcare professionals measuring the vital signs of all patients during their visit to the hospital for a review will identify potential participants and invite them to participate in the study. Trained research assistants will assess the eligibility of the patients who have agreed to participate in the study. Medication adherence of patients will be assessed using the eight-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS-8) (Morisky et al., 2008). The MMAS-8 tool is chosen because it has high validity and reliability coupled with good specificity and sensitivity (Culig \\& Leppee, 2014; Laghousi et al., 2021). The first seven (7) items on the scale require a yes or no response whereas the eighth item uses a five-point Likert scale (never/rarely to all the time). The total score ranges from 0 to 8 with a score of \\<6 indicative of non-adherence.\n\nParticipants from selected health facilities who are eligible and consent to participate in the study will be randomized into the control and intervention groups. The intervention group patients will receive either phone calls or videos thrice weekly for a period of 3 months in addition to usual care. The interventions will be administered on days and times convenient for the participants. Thrice weekly has been chosen because a similar study conducted by Bhandari et al. (2022) utilized the same frequency to send text messages and found that it improved adherence to antihypertensive medicines. The participants who will receive the video-based intervention will be given 3 gigabytes of data for the study.\n\nThe control group will only receive care as usual for the 3 months. Baseline and post-intervention data will be collected. The baseline data comprises general information (name, telephone number, date and time of interview as well as days and time convenient for them to receive the interventions), socio-demographic characteristics, blood pressure measurement, hypertension knowledge and medication adherence rating based on MMAS-8"

Women will be randomized to either the Delivering HOPE arm or the ESoC arm, with approximately 720 participants per arm. Participants randomized to the ESoC arm will receive the standard clinical protocol for nutritional and gestational weight gain counseling recommended for all pregnant women, WIC and SNAP enrollment assistance, referrals to safety net food organizations.Those randomized to the Delivering HOPE arm will be provided the same nutritional and gestational weight gain counseling, WIC and SNAP assistance, and food referrals, as well as a total of $1000/$2000/$3000 (depending on household size) during pregnancy to be used specifically for the purchase of healthy foods recommended in the nutritional counseling. Data for the primary outcome (pre-pregnancy weight and weight at delivery) will be collected from birth records."

          "briefSummary": "Ramadan, a fasting period observed by many Muslim patients, poses a significant challenge for glycemic management in diabetics. During this month, abstinence from food, water, and medication from dawn to dusk leads to significant glycemic fluctuations. Inadequate insulin dose management can cause acute complications such as hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, ketosis, or hyperosmolar states. In 2021, the Diabetes and Ramadan (DAR) guidelines provided recommendations for adjusting insulin doses, taking into account changes in circadian rhythms and patients' dietary habits. However, these standardized recommendations may not be suitable for everyone. A personalized alternative, the Carbohydrate Fasting Test (CFT), allows for the assessment of individual basal insulin needs through a controlled fast excluding carbohydrates for 24 hours. Comparing these two approaches could provide valuable insights into their relative effectiveness, particularly in terms of safety and quality of life for patients.\n\nMoreover, diabetes can be influenced by fasting, with potentially beneficial effects on inflammation and metabolism.\n\nThis study aims to determine which of these two methods optimizes glycemic control and to assess the variations of inflammation markers before and after Ramadan fasting. The results could be integrated into future clinical practices to improve diabetes management during Ramadan. We aim to compare the effectiveness and safety of basal insulin dose adjustments according to DAR 2021 guidelines versus the Carbohydrate Fasting Test (CFT) and to analyze the impact on the quality of life of diabetic patients. This is a prospective, longitudinal, randomized, interventional study including 60 Type 2 diabetic patients, aged 18 to 70 years old, on insulin therapy for at least 6 months. All participants intend to fast during Ramadan and are at low to moderate risk according to the IDF-DAR score (≤6).\n\nEligible patients will be randomly assigned into two groups:\n\nDAR Group: Insulin dose adjustments according to DAR 2021 recommendations. CFT Group: Personalized insulin adjustments based on a Carbohydrate Fasting Test conducted before Ramadan.\n\nProtocol:\n\nInitial assessment will be Clinical ( Weight, BMI, blood pressure) and biological (Fasting glucose, HbA1c, fructosamine and inflammatory markers ( Interleukin 6 and TNF alfa)).\n\nDuring Ramadan, weekly glycemic monitoring will be conducted to track blood sugar levels. Any complications will be recorded, and insulin dose adjustments will be made remotely if necessary to ensure optimal glycemic control.\n\nIn the last week of Ramadan, a final clinical assessment will be performed, including measurements of weight, BMI, and blood pressure. A biological assessment will also be conducted to measure fructosamine levels and inflammatory markers ( Interleukin 6 and TNF alfa).\n\nTwo months after Ramadan, fasting glucose and HbA1c levels will be re-evaluated to assess long-term glycemic control. The study will also analyze the impact on glycemic regulation, anthropometric parameters, and overall quality of life using the SF-12 questionnaire.\n\nIn conclusion, this project aims to identify the most effective method for adjusting basal insulin doses during Ramadan, contributing to optimal Type 2 diabetes management and to assess the variations of inflammation markers before and after Ramadan fasting."

If you agree to participate, you will take part in 2 clinic visits that are 4-6 weeks apart. At the clinic visits you will have an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and other blood tests to see how your body processes glucose (sugar). An OGTT is a test in which your drink glucose and then blood samples are taken afterward at specific time points to measure glucose and insulin in your blood. Each clinic visit will last about 5 hours."

Participants in this study will attend pharmacist-led educational sessions designed to improve their understanding of diabetes and self-care practices. Researchers will assess changes in patients' knowledge, self-management behaviors, and clinical health markers before and after the intervention. The study will compare pre- and post-intervention results to determine the effectiveness of pharmacist-led education in transforming diabetes care.",
          "detailedDescription": "The purpose of this study is to investigate whether pharmacist-led education can enhance the knowledge, self-management behaviors, and health outcomes of diabetic patients. Effective diabetes management requires a comprehensive understanding of the disease, adherence to lifestyle modifications, and consistent monitoring of health indicators. Poor knowledge and suboptimal self-care can lead to inadequate glycemic control, complications, and reduced quality of life. This study will evaluate the impact of pharmacist-led educational interventions on patients' motivation, diabetes-related knowledge, and self-care behaviors, as well as their effects on clinical outcomes, including improved HbA1c levels, reduced hypo- and hyperglycemic episodes, and enhanced patient satisfaction. By addressing these critical aspects, the study aims to highlight the transformative role of pharmacist-led education in advancing diabetes care and fostering sustainable, patient-centered healthcare practices."

The main question it aims to answer are:\n\n1. Can cell-free RNA-based biomarkers predict which pregnant people are at greatest risk of developing adverse pregnancy outcomes (e.g., preterm birth, preeclampsia)?\n2. What is the performance of such biomarkers when predicting an adverse pregnancy outcome (e.g., sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, TPR)?",
          "detailedDescription": "This is a multi-center, prospective, observational cohort study, that involves the collection of blood samples from pregnant people during their second trimester of pregnancy. Maternal plasma is isolated from blood samples and subjected to transcriptome and other multi-omic analyses. In conjunction with blood sample collection, extensive clinical data are collected about the pregnancy including any pregnancy complications (e.g., preterm birth, preeclampsia) that may have arisen during pregnancy. Biological markers and clinical data are combined to develop and validate Mirvie's investigational predictive test."

          "detailedDescription": "This will be a single-dose study, in normal participants and in those with current retinal pathology, investigating feasibility of the investigational dye, MB-102, for use in fluorescent angiography compared to fluorescein sodium. Safety and tolerability of MB-102 will also be evaluated. Control dye fluorescein sodium will be administered intravenously a minimum of 3 days prior to MB-102 dosing. After IV administration of dyes, images will be acquired of both eyes with a Zeiss fundus camera (and for some participants additional fundus photography will be performed with clinically-approved ocular angiography imaging systems) by a trained ophthalmic photographer. Participants will return for a follow-up visit after MB-102 dosing for further physical examination, clinical laboratory tests, and reporting of any adverse events. Photographs will be examined for quality as well as the utility of the angiography in evaluating disease diagnosis and progression."

With the development of artificial intelligence and other technologies, it provides technical support for the construction of intelligent mobile screening model for eye diseases. The investigator's team has developed the 5G intelligent ophthalmic vehicle and served tens of thousands of people in 108 cities nationwide, initially verifying the feasibility of the new intelligent mobile screening model. However, the application effect, acceptance and influencing factors of this model in different regions are not clear, and there is a lack of economic benefit analysis based on real-world data. In this study, the investigators will conduct a cross-sectional study of large-scale population screening for blinding eye diseases in grassroots areas through the smart mobile screening model, focusing on the screening effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the smart mobile screening model, integrating real-world multimodal eye health data, developing multiple smart screening analysis models, and exploring its adaptability and direction of improvement in grassroots areas."

          "detailedDescription": "A two-centre observational study conducted in Denmark, including adults with type 1 diabetes (n=500) on multiple daily injections already using FreeStyle Libre 2.\n\nUpon recruitment, participants will complete a survey of 11 validated questionnaires, including T1-DDS-28. For 14 days, participants will continue regular CGM use, smart insulin pens will record real-time insulin dosage, and an activity sensor will monitor physical activity and sleep. Participants will register food intake in the LibreLink app and respond to queries on quality of life twice daily through REDCap. At the end of the study, participants will complete the T1-DDS-28 and Health Literacy Questionnaire.\n\nOur primary objectives is to investigate the association between diabetes distress (assessed by Type 1 Diabetes Distress Scale (T1-DDS-28)) and:\n\n1. frequency of reading CGM data,\n2. frequency of low glucose alarms,\n3. frequency of high glucose alarms,\n4. frequency of daily between-meal insulin corrections,\n5. frequency of hypoglycaemic events preceded by correction of hyperglycaemia with insulin,\n6. frequency of hyperglycaemic events preceded by correction of hypoglycaemia with carbohydrates, and\n7. sociodemographic and psychosocial characteristics of CGM users.\n\nOur secondary objective is to investigate the association between glycaemic metrics and the variables described above. Glycaemic metrics will be reported as CGM-metrics, including time in range defined as the percentage of time the sensor glucose is 3.9-10.0 mmol/L (70-180 mg/dL), per international consensus (ATTD, 2022)"

In this effectiveness-implementation type III cluster-randomized trial, we will compare two implementation strategies for DPP delivery: an in-person health coach-led implementation strategy (standard 24 in-person sessions) vs. a multifaceted technology-assisted health coach implementation strategy (12 in-person sessions supplemented by technology tools).\n\nNineteen clinics will be randomized to the multifaceted technology-assisted health coach strategy and 19 to the in-person health coach-led strategy. A total of 722 postpartum participants (19 per clinic) will be recruited into the study and followed for 12 months for implementation and effectiveness outcomes. A post-intervention study visit will take place 6 months after the end of the 12-month intervention to evaluate the sustainability of the implementation strategies."

          "briefSummary": "Type 1 diabetes (T1D) results from destruction of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas by the body's own immune system (autoimmunity). It is not fully understood what causes this type of diabetes and why there is variation in age of onset and severity between people who develop the disease. The aim of this work is to study very unusual people who develop T1D extremely young, as babies under 2 years of age (EET1D). The investigators think that, for the condition to have developed that early, they must have an unusual or extreme form of autoimmunity.\n\nStudying people with EET1D will enable us to look at exactly what goes wrong with the immune system because they have one of the most extreme forms of the disease. Much may be learned about the disease from a small number of rare individuals. The investigators aim to confirm that they have autoimmune type 1 diabetes and then try to understand how they have developed diabetes so young by studying their immune system genes, the function of their immune system, and environmental factors (such as maternal genetics) that may play a role in their development of the disease.\n\nPeople with diabetes diagnosed under 12 months are very rare, live all over the world. and are usually referred to Exeter for genetic testing. Individuals will be contacted via their clinician to ask for more information about their diabetes and their family history. Samples will be collected to study whether they still make any of their own insulin and whether they make specific antibodies against their beta cells in the pancreas. Separately, their immune system will be studied in depth using immune cells isolated from a blood sample. These cells will undergo cutting edge techniques by Dr Tim Tree at King's College London, by Professor Bart Roep at Leiden University Medical Center, Netherlands, and Dr Cate Speake, Benaroya Research Institute, Seattle (USA). Some of these tests have never been used in people of young ages around the world, so an aim of this project will be to develop methods that can be used to study people even if they live far away.\n\nAdditional funding extended the study for a further 3 years (Phase 2) to include recruitment of infants without diabetes, aged 0-6 years, as controls to enable assessment of how the abnormalities found in autoimmune and non-autoimmune diabetes compare to normal early life development of the immune system.\n\nAn additional funding award extended the study (Phase 3) until November 2028, to advance the EXE-T1D program into its third phase, building on major discoveries from phases 1 and 2 to identify, validate, and target immune pathways that drive extremely early-onset type 1 diabetes (eeT1D) and are likely relevant to T1D across all ages. eeT1D cases, diagnosed within the first two years of life, represent particularly aggressive onset of beta-cell autoimmunity. They offer a unique lens to uncover mechanisms of immune dysregulation, informed by both polygenic and monogenic causes. The central aim is to move from pathway discovery to demonstration of novel druggable targets with potential to delay or prevent T1D onset across all ages.",
          "detailedDescription": "Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a common autoimmune disease that causes destruction of pancreatic, insulin producing beta cells, leading to high blood glucose. T1D is regarded as a childhood disease with an average age of diagnosis of 13 years, but the age presentation is very variable from young infants until late adulthood.\n\nIn Exeter, a group of rare children who have developed T1D in the first year of life (Patel) is described as having Extremely Early-onset Type 1 Diabetes (EET1D). Studying these rare patients is important because they are presenting with autoimmunity at the beginning of life when the immune system is not yet fully developed and at a time when pancreatic autoimmunity first emerges (Krisher), so this study may give novel insights into the cause of T1D.\n\nThe Exeter Molecular Genetics Laboratory is a world referral centre (www.diabetesgenes.org) for Neonatal Diabetes (NDM). Most cases of diabetes diagnosed under 6 months do not have EET1D but have genetic mutations in beta cell genes that lead to impaired insulin production (NDM)(Ellard; De Franco). Exeter is able to identify the remaining \\<20% without a mutation in a beta cell gene who actually have EET1D. Exeter uses a novel measure of T1D risk genes, called the T1D Genetic Risk Score (T1D GRS), showing that a proportion of the remaining patients have very high T1D risk and therefore EET1D(Patel). Understanding the mechanism for very early presentation could be highly important as immune strategies to intervene before or after people get T1D may differ by age of onset.\n\nThe results may focus the research community on events that occur before birth and may then inform new efforts to prevent or intervene in the underlying destruction of beta cells in T1D.\n\nAdditional funding extended the study to include recruitment of infants without diabetes, aged 0-6 years, as controls to enable assessment of how the abnormalities found in autoimmune and non-autoimmune diabetes compare to normal early life development of the immune system.\n\nHypotheses:\n\ni) Extreme early-onset T1D (EET1D) is associated with classic biomarkers of T1D, such as islet specific autoantibodies, autoreactive islet specific CD8 T cells, and loss of beta cell function, whereas children with monogenic neonatal diabetes or without diabetes will not show abnormalities in these markers.\n\nii) EET1D will be associated with more rapid beta cell loss than T1D presenting at older ages.\n\niii) The mechanisms for EET1D will be due to rare changes in immune genes or due to a particularly potent, early response of the immune system to beta cells, as measured by autoreactive T cells or immune gene expression when compared to older onset T1D.\n\nStudy Aim: The EXE-T1D study will take people with T1D diagnosed before the age of 24 months and compare them to people with T1D diagnosed at more typical ages (1-20 years) and people diagnosed with non-autoimmune diabetes at a similar very young age (children with neonatal diabetes \\[NDM\\]), and infants without diabetes matched for age.\n\nEXE-T1D is an observational study organised into two sub-studies:\n\nStudy 1: Cross-sectional study of existing patients with EET1D (n=100 v 100): Assess islet autoantibodies, islet T cell autoimmunity, C-peptide, RNAseq, genetics and clinical features of EET1D compared to T1D in selected patients of varying ages and durations of diabetes referred over the last 15 years to the Exeter genetics team/Prof Oram.\n\nStudy 2: Newly referred patients (n=20 v 20): Recruit newly diagnosed patients with EET1D who are referred to Exeter/Prof Oram for diagnostic testing to allow assessment of immune phenotype in patients close to diagnosis(Abreu; Unger; Velthuis). Assess immune function longitudinally by collecting a blood sample for serum and peripheral lymphocytes, islet autoantibodies and C-peptide assessment shortly after referral, and approximately 2 years later.\n\nThe investigators may also be approached by patients' GPs and by patients themselves. Recruitment to the study in this setting will be by the investigator's team who will provide information about the study and feedback inclusion of the participant in the study to the GP and diabetes clinician as appropriate.\n\nUK participants will be recruited under UK wide ethics. Exeter will recruit patients from international centres in collaboration with local clinicians that have specific Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval.\n\nThe Exeter Clinical Laboratories encompass the Exeter Blood Sciences Laboratory and Exeter Molecular Genetics Laboratory at the Royal Devon and Exeter NHS Foundation Trust and will perform C-peptide, islet autoantibody and genetic tests.\n\nPeripheral lymphocyte (PBMC) analysis for autoreactive CD4 and CD8 T cells will be performed by Tim Tree (King's College London). RNAseq will be performed by Cate Speake and the Benaroya Research Institute, Seattle (USA).\n\nAll participants (or their legal guardian) recruited to the study will be required to give written informed consent and will be informed of their right to withdraw from the study at any time without prejudice or jeopardy to any future clinical care.\n\nPatients identified and screened as being suitable for this study will have a blood sample and optional urine sample collected by the clinical team at a time and location suitable for the patient, clinical and study teams.\n\nStudy 2: In addition to the first visit, a repeat blood sample for PBMC, C-peptide and Autoantibody analysis may be collected, approximately 2 years (+/-6 months) later.\n\nNon-UK samples will be collected by collaborating international centres with their own IRB approval. The local team will spin and freeze the EDTA plasma sample and store it on site while the PBMCs are extracted as per Exeter's SOP. All tubes will then be couriered to Exeter. If no local team is available to extract PBMCs, all tubes will be couriered to Exeter for analysis. For some centres, it may be possible to arrange for the samples to be flown directly to the UK for PBMC extraction.\n\nEnd of Study Definition: last participant's final study visit plus 6 months to enable follow-up data capture.\n\nSafety, Definitions and Reporting Risks Blood samples will be collected by staff trained in venepuncture. Any potential discomfort or side-effects will be equivalent to that experienced in routine clinical care.\n\nBenefits The C-peptide and autoantibody results may help to confirm a diagnosis of T1D so will be reported back to clinicians responsible for the patient's diabetes care. Decisions about ongoing clinical care and treatment will be made externally to the research study but treatment will be recorded.\n\nAdverse effects Should any unforeseen adverse events arise that are possibly, probably, or definitely related to a study procedure, they will be reported to the Sponsor and CI/central coordinating team within 24 hours of the CI or PI or co-investigators becoming aware of the event.\n\nConfidentiality All information related to study participants will be kept confidential and managed in accordance with the Data Protection Act, NHS Caldicott Guardian, The Research Governance Framework for Health and Social Care and Research Ethics Committee Approval.\n\nParticipant data will be held in a link-anonymised format, with personal identifiable data only accessible to personnel with training in data protection who require this information to perform their study role.\n\nRecord Retention and Archiving When the research study is complete, it is a requirement of the Research Governance Framework and Sponsor Trust Policy that the records are kept for a further 15 years.\n\nLocal investigator site files must be archived at the external site according to local R\\&D requirements. They will not be stored at the coordinating centre's archiving facility.\n\nStatistical Considerations Sample Size Total recruitment target is at least 240: Study 1: 100 with EET1D plus 100 controls (N=200); Study 2: EET1D v Monogenic / NDM controls (N=30+); Non-diabetic controls: (N=20+) Feasibility: The sample size has been selected to assess feasibility rather than on the basis of statistical power. In reality with these extremely rare but potentially very interesting patients, every single patient recruited could contribute on their own to a novel discovery. The immune, beta cell or autoantibody differences the study may reveal are unknown but a group of 20 v 20 gives an 80% power (alpha 0.05) to detect a difference of 10% v 50% in a proportion between the two groups and a power of 85% (alpha 0.05) to detect a 1 SD difference in a continuous variable.\n\nStatistical analysis: The EET1D as described are unique and findings in the various studies are difficult to predict given the novel nature of this study. The study using 100 EET1D v 100 controls gives a 90% power (alpha 0.05) to detect a difference in proportions of a binary variable of 50% v 30% and a 0.6SD difference in a continuous variable, and similarly a group of 20 v 20 gives an 80% power (alpha 0.05) to detect a difference of 10% v 50% in the two groups and a power of 85% (alpha 0.05) to detect a 1 SD difference in a continuous variable.\n\nMonitoring ensure compliance with Good Clinical Practice. The Investigators will permit monitoring, audits, REC review, and regulatory inspections by providing the Sponsor(s), Regulators and REC direct access to source data and other documents.\n\nNo financial and other competing interests to disclose for the Chief Investigator, PIs at each site and committee members for the overall study management.\n\nNHS Indemnity will apply to UK participants and UK public liability insurance is provided by the University of Exeter.\n\nAccidental protocol deviations must be adequately documented and reported to the Chief Investigator and Sponsor immediately.\n\nAccess to the final study dataset The Exeter study team will have access to the final dataset. Of the multiple analyses done during the study, relevant co-investigators for each analysis (e.g. RNAseq for Cate Speake) will have access to the datasets they have contributed to.\n\nPublic and Patient Involvement The CI's direct contact with patients with a diagnosis of diabetes in the first 12 months of life led to the study design. Patients, relatives and clinicians agree there would be significant benefit to knowing why and how T1D can present so young and whether understanding this could help with treatment or prevention.\n\nFunders: Diabetes UK; The Leona M. and Harry B. Helmsley Charitable Trust. Publication Policy: On completion of the study, the data will be analysed and a Final Study Report will be prepared and submitted to the Funders, Sponsor and REC."

          "briefSummary": "Currently, clinicians are unable to predict a patient's risk of long-term disease progression and development of a long-term complication based on the data that is available to them. The first aim of this is to develop and validate an Artificial Intelligence (AI) powered prediction model for Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) disease progression using existing data from previously collected studies and real-world electronic health medical data. Investigators will use clinical, pharmacologic, and genomic factors to develop the prediction model based on the most relevant clinical outcomes of change in Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and the development of a microvascular complication.\n\nDespite the availability of newer medication options, lifestyle intervention is not effective in most youth and current therapeutic options are ineffective at producing sustained glycemic control. Newer and innovative methods are needed to identify the youth at highest risk of progression in terms of increase in HbA1c and development of long-term complications and to motivate behavioral change in youth. The goal of this aim is to create an AI-powered digital twin model for 50 youth with T2D using their baseline clinical, genetic, pharmacologic and lifestyle data and utilize AI algorithms developed in Aim 1 to simulate disease progression and treatment response. Investigators will then evaluate the digital twin model in an randomized controlled trail and prospectively compare the generated digital twin data to observed values over one year. Investigators will also measure whether knowledge of the digital twin prediction with targeted healthcare recommendations influence medication and lifestyle change adherence in the digital twin arm (n= 25) compared to the control arm (n= 25)."

Diabetic patients presenting with chronic nonhealing ulcers will be screened for eligibility. At least 50% of the eligible population will be drawn from patients ≥ 65 years of age. All patients will complete a 2-week run-in period prior to treatment allocation to Amnio-Maxx and standard of care (SOC) or SOC alone. Patients will be seen at weekly intervals (± 3 days) for the 12 weeks treatment period. If additional dressing changes are required between the scheduled visits, the occurrence of these visits will be recorded. Primary efficacy endpoints include percentage change in ulcer size at 12 weeks along with the proportion of participants achieving complete wound closure. Additionally, pain and safety will be assessed as secondary endpoints."

          "briefSummary": "The overall objective of this 13-month randomized crossover study is to seek evidence demonstrating that daily consumption of peanuts and peanut products improve cardiometabolic, cognitive, and intestinal health in a racially diverse prediabetes population.",
          "detailedDescription": "In the US, 37.1 million adults have diabetes mellitus and 96 million have prediabetes. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) accounts for 95% of the cases and results in many public health complications that increase economic burden and reduce productivity and quality of life. Eight out of 10 people with T2DM die from cardiovascular disease, while those with T2DM also face a 50% higher risk of developing dementia compared to healthy individuals. Also, studies indicate that intestinal health significantly influences the development of T2DM. Of note, the burden of T2DM is particularly pronounced in non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic populations compared to the non-Hispanic White population. Prevention and treatment of T2DM focus on lifestyle changes including dietary modifications. Plant-based foods, including peanuts and peanut products, have been increasingly recognized for their importance in the prevention and management of prediabetes and T2DM due to their unique nutritional profile, including their favorable fatty acid composition, fiber content, and bioactive compounds. While emerging evidence indicates that peanut improves cardiometabolic, cognitive and intestinal health, no studies have collectively and comprehensively evaluated the effects of peanut or peanut product consumption on the cardiometabolic, cognitive, and intestinal health of individuals with prediabetes or T2DM. Thus, this study aims to investigate whether adults with prediabetes consuming 43 g of peanut butter (1 snack cup) 3 x/week, 42 g of dry roasted peanuts (1/3 of a cup) 3x/week, or 56 g of peanut flour 1x/week for six months will have 1) reduced levels of serum HbA1c, fasting glucose (FBG), insulin, HOMA-IR (homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance) and improved lipid profile, 2) reduced blood pressure, improved endothelial function, arterial stiffness and microvascular function, 3) Improved gut microbiota composition and reduced intestinal permeability, 4) improved cognitive function (verbal memory and executive functions \\[inhibition, working memory, cognitive flexibility\\]) and brain health metrics as assessed by neuroimaging, and 5) reduced serum markers of oxidative stress and inflammation. The effectiveness of the intervention on the abovementioned outcomes among races including non-Hispanic Black (NHBA), non-Hispanic White (NHWA), non-Hispanic Asian (NHAA) and Hispanic (HA) adults will also be compared. Lastly, whether changes in cardiometabolic and cognitive outcomes are associated with changes in intestinal microbiota outcomes and whether changes in cardiometabolic outcomes are associated with changes in cognitive function parameters will be explored."

These samples will be scanned using a Raman spect to obtain Raman spectral data. The scattering peaks in the Raman spectra will be analyzed using Origin software for Gaussian curve fitting. The position of the peaks will used to query relevant literature to identify the corresponding chemical bonds and confirm the presence of compounds.\n\nThe intensity and area of the chemical substance peaks in the Raman will be calculated and used to plot calibration curves, thereby establishing a quantitative analysis equation. This equation will be used to accurately calculate the concentration of each analyte in serum and urine samples. Based on the average concentration data for each patient group, multivariate analysis methods, such as principal component analysis (PCA) and Mahalanis distance discriminant model, will be used to classify and predict the disease types.\n\nThe preliminary data for this study comes from the Nephrology Department ofianfoshan Hospital, where different types of glomerular diseases have been pathologically classified using tools such as light microscopy, electron microscopy, and immunoforescence microscopy. By combining Raman spectroscopy technology and statistical analysis, this study aims to establish a non-invasive and efficient diagnostic tool to assist in the of kidney diseases and predict treatment outcomes."

          "briefSummary": "The overall goal of the Study of Women, Infant Feeding and Type 2 Diabetes after GDM pregnancy (SWIFT) is to determine the relation of longer and more intensive lactation, as compared to formula feeding, on progression to incident type 2 diabetes mellitus among women within several years following delivery of a GDM pregnancy. The initial study enrolled women with recent GDM at 6 to 9 weeks post-delivery to reclassify oral glucose tolerance and conduct subsequent testing of glucose tolerance to ascertain progression to overt diabetes up to two years later. Research methods were utilized to assess lactation intensity and duration quantitatively and to evaluate incidence rates of diabetes, as well as changes in blood glucose levels, insulin resistance, body weight, waist circumference, and overall adiposity from baseline and up to several years later. SWIFT is a prospective, observational cohort study of 1,035 women recruited during pregnancy who were diagnosed with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) via Carpenter and Coustan criteria and enrolled into the research study. We assessed the natural history of progression to prediabetes and type 2 diabetes from early postpartum for a racially and ethnically diverse cohort of women with GDM (75% minority) at high-risk for developing overt diabetes within 5-10 years post-delivery.",
          "detailedDescription": "The SWIFT study recruited women during pregnancy, and enrolled 1,035 women diagnosed with GDM who delivered a singleton, live born infant of at least 35 weeks gestation at a Kaiser Permanente Northern California hospital from 2008 to 2011, and met other study eligibility criteria. Women with recent GDM consented to three in-person research exams with the first exam at 6-9 weeks postpartum (study baseline) and the two follow up research exams continuing annually thereafter for two years post-baseline. SWIFT participants continued to be followed for clinical diagnoses of diabetes via the KPNC electronic health record system during the subsequent years through present. The study enrollment of participants began in late 2008 and ended in December 2011, and in-person follow up exams through 2014. The SWIFT cohort is racially and ethnically diverse (75% minority) with 35% Asian (1/3 South Asian, 1/3 Southeast Asian, 1/3 Chinese), 9% Black, 31% Hispanic, 23% White, and 2% mixed race/Native groups, and includes a longitudinal research Biobank, and research datasets, and clinical electronic health record data for diagnoses of diabetes and other clinical measures.\n\nEach woman provided written informed consent for three in-person exams involving administration of the 2-hour 75 gram Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) to reclassify glucose tolerance in women following GDM pregnancy, and numerous other research assessments. At baseline, 21 women were classified with overt diabetes and excluded from follow up, 2 women dropped out at baseline, and 2 women were ineligible. There were 1,010 women with recent GDM and no diabetes at baseline who were followed to evaluate the primary study outcome, the progression to glucose intolerance during the two year follow up period, defined as incident diabetes by American Diabetes Association (ADA) criteria from the 2-hour 75 gram OGTT glucose values, and/or clinical medical diagnosis of diabetes. The annual study follow up exams during the 2 years post-baseline occurred from 2009-2014. The study cohort continues in ongoing follow up for progression to diabetes and subsequent pregnancies via laboratory testing from the Kaiser Permanente electronic health records through present (72% remain KPNC health plan members). A 4th in person research exam is enrolling SWIFT participants in 2022-2024,\n\nThe primary exposure for the study is lactation intensity and duration assessed quantitatively using the method by Piper et al. 2001 to estimate a continuous lactation intensity and duration score up to 12 months postpartum. The study assessed infant feeding prospectively from prenatal telephone contacts to assess breastfeeding intention via a standardized method, inpatient hospital delivery records, participant infant feeding diaries, telephone contacts at 1 month postpartum, self-administered monthly mailed surveys (from 3 to 11 months postpartum), and from surveys at the three in-person annual study exams. Data collection during and after pregnancy was also obtained from electronic health records related to perinatal course (e.g., laboratory diagnosis of GDM phenotype severity: 3-hr OGTT z-score and GDM treatment, gestational age at GDM diagnosis, maternal pre-pregnancy BMI, gestational weight gain), medical history, prenatal measures, subsequent pregnancies, and the maternal and newborn outcomes.\n\nSubsequent studies of metabolites preceding progression to overt diabetes after gestational diabetes pregnancy are underway. Investigations are ongoing to measure changes in metabolomics, proteomics and lipidomics at the baseline and follow up exams.\n\nAt each of three study exams, trained research staff assessed maternal characteristics (infant feeding, sociodemographics, medical and reproductive history, subsequent pregnancies, medication use, recurrence of GDM, physical activity, dietary intake, depression, and sleep habits/disorders), as well as breastfeeding intensity and duration, infant health, and complementary infant dietary intake using self- and interviewer-administered questionnaires. Trained research staff measured participant anthropometry and body composition via bioelectrical impedance assessment according to standardized research protocols, as well as collected, processed, and stored biospecimens from 2-hour 75 g OGTTs (fasting and 2-h plasma and buffy coat), and administered questionnaires at each in-person exam.\n\nThe SWIFT Offspring Study, an ancillary study of mother-infant dyads, conducted three in-person exams from 6-9 weeks, 6 months and 12 months to evaluate infant ponderal growth (weight and length) during the first year of life as well as sleep, infant temperament, dietary intake, skinfold thickness, breastfeeding and formula feeding, and collect saliva specimens in the infants of the SWIFT mothers.\n\nOngoing surveillance to ascertain new diagnoses of diabetes in the SWIFT cohort occurred both during and after the study period via the KPNC electronic health records from 2009 to 2018. The SWIFT study plans to recontact all 1,033 active participants in 2019 to conduct a fourth in-person exam at 12 years post-baseline from 2022-2024 (delayed due to COVID-19 pandemic). The fourth in-person research exam at 12-years post-baseline will reassess glucose tolerance, anthropometry, body composition and other attributes as described previously. The SWIFT study also utilizes fasting plasma specimens sampled within the early postpartum period to identify metabolites for the early prediction of future progression to type 2 diabetes. Changes in anthropometry, lifestyle behaviors, and risk factors for diabetes will also be assessed at the 12-year post-baseline in-person exam."

This 16-week study will use an experimental approach called the Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial to help determine which combination and sequence of weight loss program features are most effective in people who are at risk for type 2 diabetes. Participants in the study will be initially randomized to consume either a high or reduced carbohydrate diet. After 4 weeks, participants will be identified as Responders (greater than or equal to 2.5% weight loss) or Non-Responders (less than 2.5% weight loss). Responders will continue with their initial randomized group for the remainder of the trial. Non-responders will be re-randomized to 2nd stage interventions of either including additional exercise counseling and training or beginning a time restricted eating protocol for the remainder of the trial."

          "briefSummary": "Obesity is a major public health problem worldwide. Bariatric surgery has proved to be the most effective treatment of morbid obesity in terms of weight reduction and remission of co-morbid conditions during long-term follow-up. Sleeve Gastrectomy (SG) has become the most performed intervention either worldwide or in France, where SG represents more than 60% of bariatric interventions and 114,817 patients operated between 2013 and 2016.\n\nMaximum Excess weight loss (%EWL) after SG is obtained at one-year post surgery. Then it has been largely reported in the literature that patients could present mild, moderate or important (notably in the super obese patients) weight regain associated with comorbidity relapse motivating redo surgery. Like in revisional surgery, operating super-obese patient (BMI ≥50 kg/m2) is a challenge. It has been shown that achieving significant weight loss was more difficult in patients with a BMI ≥ 50 compared to lower BMIs.",
          "detailedDescription": "In these 2 populations of patients, more malabsorptive procedures like long limb One Anastomosis Gastric Bypass or Bilio-Pancreatic Diversion with Duodenal Switch could be more efficient but induce technical difficulties (high complication rate) and can be responsible for malnutrition (vitamin deficiencies, hypoalbuminemia…). That's why, in case of revisional surgery or for high BMI patients,laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGBP) is still considered as the gold standard and is the most performed intervention. To obtain better weight loss safely,Santoro et al. promoted the sleeve gastrectomy with transit bipartition (SG+TB), a new intervention coupling a SG without interrupting pathway through the duodenum and preserving the pylorus and a long biliary limb RYGBP.\n\nHypothesis: Because there is no duodenal and jejunal exclusion, malnutrition is expected to be less frequent after SG+TB compared to BPD/DS. Its anastomosis on the antrum makes SG+TB easier to perform in super-obese patient than standard RYGB but more efficient in term of weight loss. Compared to BPD/DS or SADI which involves dissection of the duodenum and the confection of a duodenojejunostomy, SG+TB is also expected to be easier then safer."

          "briefSummary": "People with type 2 diabetes are at risk of complications linked with high blood sugars and these are monitored for in healthcare appointments. However, people with type 2 diabetes commonly suffer with additional health conditions that can affect the liver, heart and their breathing while sleeping. These conditions are thought to be caused by a similar underlying process that causes type 2 diabetes, as a result they are very common in people type 2 diabetes. Despite this they are not part of the routine health check for these people. Worryingly, current research suggests that the risk for developing these health problems, and direct complications of type 2 diabetes, can start at blood sugar levels below the threshold of type 2 diabetes. In a group of people said to have prediabetes. These people do not currently undergo annual healthcare appointments to monitor for these health complications or other linked health conditions.\n\nThis study aims to pilot a new style of clinic to address these issues. The investigators will perform a multi-morbidity assessment, where they will look for several different health problems at the same time. The investigators will be looking at health problems linked with high blood sugars, this will include problems with the liver, heart, nerves, eyes, and participants breathing overnight. They have developed a clinic visit which uses questionnaires, simple examination techniques and modern devices to try and identify these health problems.\n\nAn important part of healthcare is the burden it places on people with health problems, with this in mind the investigators will be giving the people involved in their study a voice to try and direct future research and healthcare, the investigators will ask them to provide feedback on their experience in taking part in the study and what their thoughts are in undergoing a longer but more comprehensive health appointment."

          "detailedDescription": "This clinical assay will include 5 visits: the screening visit and four 9-hour postprandial metabolic sessions (A0, A1, B0 and C0) before and after surgery:\n\n* initial visit: screening\n* before surgery: 2 metabolic sessions A0 and A1 (without/with niacin) will be performed, in random order, at least one week interval.\n* 12 days post surgery: 1 metabolic session B0 (without niacin)\n* 1 year post surgery: 1 metabolic session C0 (without niacin)\n\nEach metabolic visit will last 9 hours with:\n\n* perfusion of stable tracers,\n* ingestion of a liquid meal\n* Positron-Emitting-Tomography (PET) acquisitions using radiopharmaceuticals such as \\[18F\\]-fluoro-6-thia-heptadecanoic acid (\\[18F\\]-FTHA) and \\[11C\\]-palmitate,\n* MRI acquisitions.\\[18F\\]fluoro-6-thia-heptadecanoic acid (FTHA).\n\nThe niacin will be given during metabolic visits A1 as a regulator of lipids metabolism. During these visits, the subjects will ingest 150mg every half hour for 6 hours. Niacin will be used as a pharmacological suppressor of dietary fatty acid (DFA) spillover in order to determine the role played by this mechanism in the reduction of postprandial endogen glucose production (EGP) in T2D after bariatric surgery."

          "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to determine whether the sequence of macronutrient consumption affects post-prandial glycaemia in women with gestational diabetes mellitus.\n\nThe main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* The difference in the magnitude of postprandial rise in blood glucose between the two test meals.\n* The difference in the magnitude of postprandial change in serum levels of gut hormones between the two test meals.\n* The difference in mean change in pre-post ingestion satiety scores between the two test meals.\n* The difference in 24 hour energy and macronutrient intake following the two test meals.\n\nParticipants will attend two study visits at the Centre for Public Health, with an interval of at least two days between the visits and complete the following, anthropometric measurements, demographic and appetite questionnaires, glucose measurements, two food diaries and fasting blood samples and the consumption of the study breakfast. Participants will be asked to eat either the protein/fat-based component of the meal (scrambled egg) before or after the carbohydrate-based component (wholemeal toast) on their first visit and on the other visit they will be asked to eat the meal in the reverse order. The order in which this occurs will be randomised and each participant will act as their own control. Researchers will compare the results from participants between the two test meals to see if the order of macronutrient consumption has any effect on post-prandial glycaemia, gut hormones, satiety scores and energy and macronutrient intake.",
          "detailedDescription": "Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is glucose intolerance with onset or first diagnosis during pregnancy, affecting around 1 in 10 pregnancies in the United Kingdom (UK). Women with GDM are 10 times more likely to develop type 2 DM and twice as likely to develop cardiovascular disease in later life than women without GDM. Dietary modification is recommended as first line management to optimise blood glucose control. However, this often fails, necessitating the use of medication such as metformin and insulin. There is a pressing need to find safe and effective dietary approaches to optimise glycaemic control in GDM which can be easily adhered to in order to improve longer-term outcomes. The impact of the sequence of macronutrients on glycaemic control is an emerging area of interest. Recent evidence suggests that the consumption of the fat/protein components of a meal prior to the carbohydrate components, reduces the peak by around 40% after food. This study aims to determine whether the order that macronutrients (i.e. protein, fat, carbohydrate) are eaten affects; blood sugar glucose levels in the blood after a meal, appetite, food intake and the release of hormones in the body, in women with GDM.\n\nPregnant women with GDM, aged 18-50 years old are eligible for the study. Women are not eligible if they have a history of type 1 or 2 diabetes, any clinically confirmed food allergies, taking medication for GDM, severe nausea or using anti-sickness medication.\n\nRecruitment will be via antenatal clinics in the South-Eastern Health and Social Care Trust (SEHSCT). Participants will attend the Centre for Public Health on two occasions (maximum 2 weeks between visits) and will involve the collection of demographic information, weight and height measurements, blood samples, glucose measurements, consumption of study breakfast, and completion of two 1-day food diaries.\n\nParticipants will be asked to eat either the protein/fat-based component of the meal (scrambled egg) before or after the carbohydrate-based component (wholemeal toast) on their first visit and on the other visit they will be asked to eat the meal in the reverse order. The order in which this occurs will be randomised and each participant will act as their own control. Scrambled egg was chosen as the protein and fat will be homogenously distributed (compared to boiled egg, for example). Wholemeal toast was chosen as, although lower glycaemic index and therefore less likely to expeditiously raise blood glucose than toasted white bread, it will be more consistent with the participants' existing dietary needs."

          "briefSummary": "The main objective of this study is to generate diagnosis and therapeutic-decision tools through the identification of molecular causes of PIDs with autoimmunity/inflammation and the variability in disease outcome at the transcriptional level using a combination of omics signatures (transcriptomics, epigenomics, proteomics, metagenomics, metabolomics and lipidomics).",
          "detailedDescription": "Primary Immune deficiencies (PIDs) are a group of monogenic diseases related to developmental or functional dysfunction of one or several immune cell types. Individually there are rare entities, but collectively they group several thousands of patients.\n\nApproximately 500 000 patients suffer from PIDs worldwide, making their management a true health-care concern. According to European Society for Immunodeficiencies (ESID), the age group in which PIDs is most frequently diagnosed is under 19 years of age (62%)1. PIDs are causing susceptibility to severe and life-threatening infections by common pathogens, but they also predispose to cancer and can initially manifest as autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.\n\nMultiple mechanisms underlie the development of autoimmunity/inflammation in PIDs. Moreover, their development can be influenced by the composition of the microbiota, which shapes host metabolic and immune functions and can be modified by many environmental factors. In the last two decades a particular emphasis was given to the elucidation of the genomic mutations causing PIDs. This led to a burst of genetic diagnosis as the numbers of known monogenic causes of PIDs rose from around 200 in 2010 to more than 310 in 2017. These genomic approaches revealed that: 1) a given monogenic defect can lead to very dissimilar clinical presentations, disproving the initial concept that a monogenic defect is associated with specific clinical manifestations ; and 2) the number of cases of autosomal dominant genetic deficiencies has increased, with sometimes a partial clinical penetrance so that some relatives carrying the causal genetic variant remain asymptomatic. Hence, onset and presentation of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases in PIDs is highly unpredictable.\n\nPIDs with autoimmunity/inflammation usually require life-long symptomatic treatments including broad immunosuppression or immunotherapies. On the long term, such treatments can have important side effects or poor efficacy and they result in high burden cost. It is therefore crucial to diagnose PIDs as early as possible in order to select the most efficient therapy based not only on clinical features as it is nowadays, but to include the underlying molecular cause of immune dysregulation.\n\nThe central goal of this project is to explain the very variable outcome of monogenic autoimmune and inflammatory diseases and to define predictive biomarkers in order to stratify patients and to optimize therapeutic choices."

This objective involves evaluating the efficacy of KL1333 versus placebo on fatigue symptoms and impacts on daily living as well as on functional lower extremity strength and endurance. Additionally, the study evaluates the safety and tolerability of KL1333.",
          "detailedDescription": "The FALCON study is investigating whether the study medicine, KL1333, improves fatigue levels and physical abilities of people living with mitochondrial disease. The investigators are also evaluating the tolerability of the study medicine. For this study, the effects of KL1333 are compared with those from a placebo (a pill that looks like the study medicine but contains no active medicine). The study medicine (or placebo) is a tablet that is taken twice daily during the treatment period of 48 weeks.\n\nParticipation in the FALCON study is divided into 3 parts:\n\n* Screening and baseline: 8-12 weeks\n* Treatment: 48 weeks\n* Safety follow-up: 5 weeks Total duration: 61 - 65 weeks\n\nPatients who complete the screening phase and are enrolled in the study are randomly assigned to receive either the study medicine (KL1333) or placebo (no active medication). Patients are more likely to receive the study medication than placebo (for every five people who take part, three receive KL1333 and two receive placebo). Neither the participants nor the study team know who is receiving the study medicine or placebo and participants are not able to change which treatment they are assigned."

In the case of an exclusionary QTcF, the ECG can be repeated twice and the average of 3 QTcF intervals should be used to determine the QTcF eligibility.\n* Recent history of unstable disease, inadequately controlled neurological manifestations or not recovered from stroke-like episodes including but not limited to:\n\n  1. stroke-like episodes within the last 6 months\n  2. more than 1 seizure/month within the last 6 months\n  3. hospitalised for Status Epilepticus within the last 6 months\n  4. more than 4 days of migraine episodes/month within the last 6 months\n* History of inflammatory bowel disease, gastric erosions, peptic ulcer disease, or gastrointestinal bleeding episodes. Gastroesophageal reflux disease diagnosed by objective endoscopic or radiographic means, and clinically symptomatic at any point over the last 6 months.\n* The patient has one or more clinical laboratory test values outside the reference range, based on the blood and urine samples taken at the Screening Visit, that are of potential risk to the patient's safety, or the patient has, at the Screening Visit:\n\n  * estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) calculated by the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) creatinine equation \\<30 mL/min/1.73 m2\n  * a serum total bilirubin value \\> 1.5 times the upper limit of the reference range unless elevation is related to Gilbert's syndrome and the investigator can rule out any underlying liver dysfunction based on other tests, the patient has a Child-Pugh score ≤6, and after discussing the case with the medical monitor\n  * a serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) value \\> 2 times the upper limit of the reference range. Values between 2 and 3 times the upper limit of the reference range may be allowed if concomitant to elevation in creatine kinase as long as the investigator can rule out any underlying liver dysfunction based on other tests, the patient has a Child-Pugh score ≤6, and after discussing the case with the medical monitor\n* The patient has, in the investigator's opinion, severe ataxia, neuropathy, balance problems or other medical condition that would interfere the evaluation of the 30s STS test.\n* Untreated or undertreated sleep apnoea, in the opinion of the investigator.\n* Use of idebenone within 14 days prior to the first dose.\n* Patients have a history of unstable or severe pulmonary, immunological, oncological, hepatic disease, renal disease, or another medically significant illness other than PMD or takes medication that could, in the investigator's opinion, interfere with the assessments of safety, tolerability, or efficacy, or interfere with the conduct or interpretation of the study.\n* The patient is, in the investigator's opinion, unlikely to comply with the protocol e.g. due to cognitive impairment or is unsuitable for any reason.\n* The patient has an immediate family member (defined as family members residing at the same address) who participates in the study.\n* Female patients with a positive pregnancy result at Screening or at Baseline.\n* A patient cannot participate if they received an investigational drug 30 days or 5 half-lives prior to the Screening Visit (whichever is longer), or plans to use an investigational drug (other than the study intervention) during the study\n* Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients or placebo.",

This cross-sectional descriptive-analytical study aims to investigate the demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics of approximately 200 patients with DFU admitted to 5 Azar Hospital, Gorgan, in 2024. Data will be retrospectively collected from medical records after obtaining ethical approval.\n\nThe study will analyze relationships between patient demographics, clinical features, and laboratory findings (including Hb, WBC, HbA1C, ESR, CRP) with ulcer severity based on Wagner's classification. Statistical tests such as independent t-test, chi-square, Fisher's exact test, and multivariable logistic regression will be used.\n\nBy identifying key factors associated with ulcer severity and outcomes, the findings of this study may contribute to more effective prevention and management strategies for diabetic foot ulcers, ultimately reducing complications and healthcare costs"

This information could be used to improve the management of antipsychotic therapies in the direction of personalized medicine, reducing metabolic risks."

The investigators hypothesize that physiological responses to the meal and to the medication will differ between carriers and non-carriers of genes associated with type 2 diabetes."

The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* To determine whether the incorporation of WI meal replacements into their weight loss clinic design is feasible.\n* To determine whether weight loss is supported by a plant-based meal replacement.\n* To assess efficacy of the meal replacements by measuring changes in lifestyle behaviours and risk factors for chronic disease compared to non-meal replacement weight loss program members.\n* To assess remission of diabetes and pre-diabetes.\n\nResearchers will compare the WLC program plus meal replacements to the WLC program without the meal replacements to evaluate the implementation of the meal replacements into the WLC.\n\nParticipants will follow their WLC program for 16 weeks, and those in the intervention group will begin their meal replacements. Participants will have a choice on what type of meal replacement they will consume each day (either a bar or a shake) and will record this in the product consumption log."

          "briefSummary": "Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is one of the most common medical complications of pregnancy. GDM, which is in the high-risk pregnancy category, causes fatigue during pregnancy due to both hormonal changes and pregnancy complications (1). Fatigue is a general complaint that occurs in almost all physical and mental diseases. Fatigue also negatively affects an individual's well-being, daily performance, activities of daily living (ADLs) and relationships. Fatigue is one of the symptoms that, if not controlled, negatively affects the individual's daily living activities and quality of life (2). While breathing itself is a way of relaxation, it is also a part of all relaxation exercises and is an exercise that can be used in daily life. Breathing correctly and deeply is the first step in learning to relax. (3). It is important to identify fatigue, minimize it, plan daily living activities and improve quality of life in patients with GDM. This study will be conducted as a randomized controlled study to determine the fatigue and quality of life of diaphragmatic breathing exercises, one of the non-pharmacological methods, on pregnant women with gestational diabetes.",
          "detailedDescription": "It will be carried out as a randomized controlled experimental design to determine the fatigue and quality of life of pregnant women with gestational diabetes.\n\nMaterial and method of the research:\n\nType of Study: This research is a randomized controlled study.\n\nResearch Questions/Hypotheses:\n\nHypothesis 0 (H0): Diaphragmatic breathing exercise has no effect on fatigue and quality of life in pregnant women with gestational diabetes.\n\nHypothesis 1 (H1): Diaphragmatic breathing exercise has an effect on fatigue and quality of life in pregnant women with gestational diabetes.\n\nLocation and Characteristics of the Research: The research will be conducted with pregnant women with gestational diabetes who applied to the gynecology outpatient clinic of Şanlıurfa Training and Research Hospital between 1 August 2023 and 1 August 2024 and who meet the inclusion criteria. This hospital was chosen due to its nature as a regional hospital and its density of pregnant women.\n\nPopulation-sample of the research: The population of this research will consist of pregnant women with gestational diabetes who were followed in the gynecology outpatient clinic of Şanlıurfa Training and Research Hospital between 1 August 2023 and 1 August 2024. The sample size was calculated as 60 pregnant women by performing GPower analysis, taking into account the tests to be used to calculate the minimum sample size to be included in the study. The sampling will include a total of 60 primiparous pregnant women, including 30 pregnant women diagnosed with gestational diabetes, who meet the inclusion criteria for the study, who agree to participate in the study, who are subjected to diaphragmatic breathing exercise, and 30 pregnant women diagnosed with gestational diabetes, who are not applied diaphragmatic breathing exercise.\n\nData Collection Forms and Tools Pregnancy Identification Form: This form was prepared and developed by researchers based on the literature. It consists of questions aimed at determining the sociodemographic, medical and obstetric characteristics of pregnant women with gestational diabetes.\n\nSF-36 Quality of Life Scale: SF-36 Quality of Life Scale is a self-assessment scale consisting of 36 questions and eight subscales, developed by Ware in 1987 to measure care outcomes in general, not specific to age, disease or treatment, and to examine health-related quality of life. . The second question of the scale includes the perception of change in health in the last 12 months, and the other questions are evaluated considering the last four weeks. The Physical and Mental Health Summary Score is obtained by weighting the scores of the questions containing the subscales of the SF-36 Quality of Life Scale. Total score calculation is not possible. The resulting summary scores and subscale scores are expressed as continuous variables ranging from 0 to 100. Zero indicates bad health, 100 indicates well-being. The scale has no cut-off point. The validity and reliability of the scale in Turkey was conducted by Pınar in 1995 on 50 cardiology, 50 hemodialysis and 80 diabetes mellitus patients. According to this; Regardless of patient groups, the test-retest reliability coefficient of the scale was found to be 0.94, and the Crohnbach's Alpha value, which indicates internal consistency, was 0.92 .\n\nVisual Similarity Scale for Fatigue: It was developed by Lee et al. in 1990 to measure the level of fatigue in various populations, including healthy adults and those with chronic diseases. The validity and reliability study of the scale for our country was conducted by Yurtsever and Bedük in 2003. YİGBS consists of 18 items. Of these items, 13 items measure Fatigue and five items measure Energy sublevel. Each item of the scale has a 10 cm horizontal line with positive statements at one end and negative statements at the other end. People who fill out this scale are asked to mark the point that best reflects the emotion they feel when reading the statements on the scale. Then, the intersection point at the marked location is measured with a ruler separately for each question, and the measured length is determined as the score of that item and evaluated objectively. The highest score that can be obtained from the fatigue subscale is 130 and the lowest score is 0. The highest score that can be obtained from the energy subscale is 50 and the lowest score is 0. A high score from the Fatigue subscale and a low score from the Energy subscale indicate that the severity of fatigue is high.\\[2\\] Cronbach's Alpha internal consistency coefficient for the 13-item fatigue subscale of the scale was found to be 0.90, and for the five-item energy subscale was 0.74.\n\nDiaphragmatic Breathing Exercise: In diaphragmatic breathing exercise; Individuals lie on their back with their legs flexed, a pillow under their head, and place their dominant hand on their abdomen and the other hand on their chest. While breathing slowly through the nose, they need to pay attention to the hand in the abdominal area and reduce the rib cage movement by increasing the abdominal movement. During inspiration, as air fills the lungs, the hand on the abdomen should rise up and the hand on the chest should not move too much. It makes participants feel relaxed and relaxed with breathing exercise.\n\nCollection of Data Data will be obtained from pregnant women with gestational diabetes who apply to the gynecology clinic of Şanlıurfa Training and Research Hospital and meet the sample selection criteria. Before the application, an explanation will be given to the pregnant women about the purpose of the research, and if they volunteer, their verbal and written consent will be obtained through the \"Informed Volunteer Consent Form\". Information about pregnant women will be collected by the researcher.\n\nApplication of Research Pregnant women will be informed about the research and written and verbal permissions will be obtained.\n\nInformation about pregnant women will be recorded. Pregnant women with gestational diabetes, whose diagnosis of gestational diabetes has been decided by the physician and who have given consent to participate in the study, will be assigned to 2 groups by randomization method: experimental (diaphragmatic breathing exercise group) and control (diaphragmatic breathing exercise group).\n\nThe first evaluations of pregnant women in both groups will be carried out between 10:00-12:00, and the Pregnancy Identification Form, Visual Similarity Scale for Fatigue and SF-36 Quality of Life Scale will be applied to the pregnant women before the training.\n\nExperimental Group: Breathing exercise will be explained to the pregnant woman in a way she can understand, will be taught and will be applied for 5 minutes. When doing the diaphragmatic breathing exercise, participants will be told to take one chest breath after 4-5 diaphragmatic breaths to avoid hyperventilation. The pregnant woman will be advised to close her eyes during exercise and concentrate on breathing and focus her attention in this direction. If there is tremors, sweating, restlessness, palpitations, numbness in the hands or lips, or uterine contraction, participants will be told to stop the exercise and rest for a few minutes. Pregnant women will be given a phone number they can reach at any time during the one-month program. Feedback will be received, questions will be answered, a training brochure will be given and the program will be completed.\n\nDuring their follow-up two weeks later, pregnant women will be asked to bring the survey form with them. The Visual Similarity Scale for Fatigue and the SF-36 Quality of Life Scale will be completed again. How he did the exercise, whether he felt any effects, and his satisfaction will be questioned. Their questions will be answered. Participants will be informed that participants need to come for a re-check in two weeks.\n\nThe Visual Similarity Scale for Fatigue and the SF-36 Quality of Life Scale will be filled out again during the follow-up after the fourth week. At the end of 30 days, the program will be completed and the survey form will be received.\n\nControl Group: No application will be performed with the participants in the control group, and these participants will be asked not to engage in regular physical activity or sports for 4 weeks and not to make any changes in their living habits.\n\nDuring their follow-up two weeks later, pregnant women will be asked to bring the survey form with them. The Visual Similarity Scale for Fatigue and the SF-36 Quality of Life Scale will be completed again. Participants will be informed that participants need to come for a re-check in two weeks.\n\nThe Visual Similarity Scale for Fatigue and the SF-36 Quality of Life Scale will be filled out again during the follow-up after the fourth week. At the end of 30 days, the program will be completed and the forms will be filled.\n\nEvaluation of Data Evaluation of the data obtained as a result of the research will be analyzed using the SPSS (Statistical Package For Social Sciences) 25.0 package program.\n\nLimitation of the Study: It is limited to pregnant women who applied to Şanlıurfa Training and Research Hospital affiliated with Şanlıurfa Provincial Health Directorate.\n\nEthical and Legal Aspects of Research Permission will be obtained from Atatürk University Clinical Research Ethics Committee before data collection. Institutional permission will be obtained from Şanlıurfa Provincial Health Directorate. Before the application, pregnant women with gestational diabetes will be informed about the purpose of the research, and if they volunteer, their verbal and written consent will be obtained through the \"Informed Volunteer Consent Form\"."

          "briefSummary": "The purpose of this research study is to investigate the effects of a combination of weekly distribution of healthy foods and intensive nutrition counseling as complementary therapies to the standard insulin therapy in children with new diagnosis of stage 3 type 1 diabetes (T1D). Feasibility, acceptability, and fidelity of this intervention will be measured. We will also explore the likelihood of prolonging the honeymoon phase of T1D in the intervention study group. Comparisons will be made between this combined nutrition intervention and free healthy foods vs. current standard nutrition counseling. Both study groups will receive standard of care treatment for T1D (insulin therapy).\n\nThe results of this study could inform future research that will ultimately lead to design of a larger clinical trial testing implementation of novel medical nutrition therapies for children newly diagnosed with stage 3 of T1D, and may lead to prolongation of the honeymoon phase. The overall goal is to promote the beta cell function survival and to reduce the progression to stage 4 of T1D.\n\nCondition or Disease:\n\n* Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus\n* New Diagnosis of Stage 3 Type 1 Diabetes ≤ 60days\n\nIntervention/Treatment:\n\n\\- Weekly Free Healthy Foods + Intensive Nutrition Counseling for 12 weeks",
          "detailedDescription": "The proposed study is a 12-week pilot, single-blinded, randomized, controlled clinical trial in prepubertal children (6-17 years old) newly diagnosed with stage 3 of type 1 diabetes (T1D) within 60 days. The total duration of the study is 24 weeks, but the nutrition intervention is only delivered during 12 weeks with a 24-week follow up visit. We expect to enroll a total of 12-40 children (6-20 per study group).\n\nWe will be investigating the potential role of a frequent personalized nutrition counseling intervention (7 sessions in a hybrid model) in addition to weekly distribution of selected healthy foods. We expect the diet quality of the youth receiving the intervention (you) will improve during and after the study intervention.\n\nThere will be two study groups: intervention and control group.\n\nThe intervention group will receive a food bag containing specific healthy foods with high anti-inflammatory properties weekly for 12 weeks, in addition to seven nutrition counseling sessions. The provided foods are a combination of 6 types of foods including: a) seasonal fruits (containing high amounts of vitamin C and vitamin E), b) legumes, c) nuts, d) yogurt, e) vegetables and f) seafood. The portions of each food group component of the \"healthy foods bag\" will follow the current USDA dietary guidelines according to the age of the study participant. \\[1\\] By contrast, the control group will receive weekly grocery store gift cards of similar monetary value of the \"healthy food bag\" in addition to seven nutrition counseling sessions based on the standard MyHealthy plate model.\n\nIn regards to the nutrition counseling sessions, this counseling will be provided as a hybrid model with a combination of 4 in-person nutrition counseling sessions and 3 virtual dietary counseling sessions provided by a registered dietitian. In summary:\n\n1. Intervention group will receive NUTRI-Beta foods basket + nutrition counseling (NUTRI-Beta dietary counseling) + standard insulin treatment (either insulin injections or insulin pump per patient preference)+ standard of care insulin therapy and use of a 24-hour continuous glucose monitor, and\n2. Control group will receive the standard nutrition counseling per the American Dietary Association (ADA) Guidelines \\[2\\] + weekly grocery store gift cards + standard of care insulin therapy and use of a 24-hour continuous glucose monitor.\n\nThe NUTRI-Beta clinical trial study visits will include a total of 10 visits during the 24 weeks of the study: Screening visit (V0), baseline visit (enrolment visit= V1), nutrition counseling visit 2 (week 2 post enrollment), nutrition counseling visit 3 (V3-virtual, week 3), nutrition counseling visit 4 (V4-in person, week 4), nutrition counseling visit 5 (V5-virtual, week 6), nutrition counseling visit 6 (V6-in person, week 8), nutrition counseling visit 7 (V7-virtual, week 10), visit 8 ( 12 weeks after enrollment- end of nutrition intervention), and visit 9 (24 weeks after enrollment).\n\nWe expect that this nutrition intervention (NUTRI-Beta) will be acceptable to children with new diagnosis of clinical diabetes (stage 3 of T1D) and will improve their diet intake and quality, their nutrition status and may increase their likelihood of residual beta-cell function in the treatment group. Evaluation of the partial remission of T1D will be completed through the determination of the insulin dose-adjusted A1C (IDAA1C) and residual beta cell function through the measurement of peak C-peptide levels during a 2-hour mixed-meal tolerance test (MMTT) after 12 and 24 weeks of the nutrition intervention.\n\nThe treatment group is expected to have higher rates of partial remission of T1D measured by the IDAA1C, better diet quality, better glycemic metrics and reduced needs of total daily dose of insulin (TDD) (unit/kg/day)."

A total of 50 volunteer patients who meet the inclusion criteria will be recruited from the Internal Medicine and Nutrition outpatient clinics of Bezmialem Vakıf University Hospital.\n\nParticipants will be prospectively evaluated through face-to-face interviews. Assessments will include body composition analysis (Omron Body Composition Monitor), waist-to-hip ratio, lower extremity muscle strength (Muscle Hand-Held Dynamometer), grip strength (Hand Grip Dynamometer), physical activity level (International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form), functional capacity (6-Minute Walk Test), balance (Biodex Balance System), clinical balance (Berg Balance Scale), and quality of life (Nottingham Health Profile).\n\nAll statistical analyses will be performed using IBM SPSS Statistics 20. With this study, we aim to comprehensively evaluate multiple parameters in individuals with T2DM and investigate their interrelationships, thereby contributing to the current body of knowledge in the literature."

Given that weight loss is associated with bone loss, its effect on bone health has recently raised concerns. Therefore, the goal of this clinical trial is to learn the effect of semaglutide on bone mineral density and fractures in patients with type 2 diabetes.\n\nThe investigators will compare semaglutide combined with metformin to metformin alone to see if semaglutide treatment has effects on bone mineral density and bone turnover markers in patients with type 2 diabetes after 12 months.\n\nThe intervention group will receive semaglutide combined with metformin for 12 months, while the control group will receive metformin alone for the same duration. After 12 months of treatment, the investigators will compare the bone mineral density, fracture incidence, and levels of bone turnover markers between the two groups."

Our hypothesis is that RC+GEM will: 1) reduce hemoglobin A1c as much or more, 2) require less diabetes medication, 3) cost less, and 4) have more secondary benefits, (e.g. greater reduction in cardiovascular risk, weight, diabetes distress, depression symptoms), compared to RC alone.",
          "detailedDescription": "The proposed study will compare individualized self-administered versions of RC+GEM to RC among patients recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. We hypothesize that, compared to RC alone, RC+GEM will be at least as effective at improving blood glucose control (A1c), and RC+GEM will do so with less reliance on diabetes medication and with greater secondary benefits such as lower risk of cardiovascular disease, more \"good\" cholesterol (HDL), greater weight loss, a greater sense of empowerment, and fewer diabetes-related expenses. It is further hypothesized that these benefits will be sustained over 13.5-months of follow-up with no structured maintenance program.\n\nRemote study visits are permitted. Clinic visit and remote visits may include videoconferencing, phone, text messages and emails."

          "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to compare a healthy KETO diet supplemented with canola oil (KETO-Can) compared to a traditional KETO diet high in saturated fat (KETO-Sat) and low-fat diet (LFD) in adults at high risk of or diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. The main question\\[s\\] it aims to answer are:\n\n* Effects on CVD risk factors (plasma cholesterol, TG, ApoB100, glucose, insulin and HbA1C).\n* Effects on systemic inflammation and immune function.\n* Adherence to interventions.\n\nParticipants will be randomized into 1 of the dietary treatments during which they will follow a Keto or a low-fat diet.\n\nComparisons among groups at 3 and 6 months of intervention will be conducted.",
          "detailedDescription": "The ketogenic diet (KETO) is popular for weight loss and is gaining interest as a treatment for type 2 diabetes (T2D) because it is believed to help manage blood glucose and weight. However, KETO is often high in saturated fats (SFA), which may increase cholesterol and other cardiovascular (CVD) risk factors, such as inflammatory profile. Substituting a heart-healthy oil for SFA may improve these outcomes.\n\nThe purpose of our study is to investigate the health beneficial effects of a healthy KETO diet supplemented with Canola oil, compared to a traditional Keto Diet and low-fat diet in adults at high risk of type 2 diabetes. Participants will be randomized to one of these three diets and will receive nutrition counselling during 6 months.\n\nEach month, participants will receive a 1-month supply of canola oil in the KETO-Can group, butter and coconut oil in the KETO-Sat group and whole grain foods (pasta or brown rice) and oatmeal in the LFD group to ensure compliance to key nutrients.\n\nFasting blood samples will be taken at baseline, 3 and 6 months. Anthropometric measurements (weight (BW), waist circumference (WC), BMI), blood pressure (BP), systemic inflammation (CRP, IL-6, TNF-α, IL-18), immune function, cardiometabolic risk factors (TG, cholesterol, glucose, insulin and HbA1C) will be determined at each time point.\n\nA total of three 24h-recall questionnaires (2 weekdays and 1 weekend day) will be completed at each time point (baseline, 3 months, 6 months). Once a month (in between study visits) a 24h-recall will be completed before meeting the nutrition expert in order to personalize recommendations according to participants' respective diet groups.\n\nAs in any nutritional study, adherence for nutrition study is a key factor and will be measured differently during the intervention. Menu examples will be provided for each group to facilitate adherence. Adherence to the study protocol will be assessed by (1) evaluation of 24-h recall data (14 in total). Participants with 11 out of 14 recalls being within meeting dietary objectives will be considered highly compliant, 6 or less would be low compliance; (2) Ketosis state will be measured at each study visit using ketone strips to assess adherence to both KETO diets; (3) Participants will be asked to report the food consumed each month to determine the level of consumption. Finally, fatty acid composition in plasma (short-term) and red blood cells (RBCs; reflect the past 3 months) will be assessed to confirm adherence between the two keto diets."

Consequently, glycemic fluctuations are observed. This phenomenon could be explained by a decrease in insulin sensitivity during the second half of the menstrual cycle (luteal phase).\n\nOverall, despite an important proportion of women reporting glycemic and/or insulin variations across the menstrual cycle, studies to date have involved small sample sizes, and have had inconsistent results. The objective of this study will be to study glycemic fluctuations across the menstrual cycle using CGM data, alongside insulin data, in a large sample of women."

          "briefSummary": "Initially, 4 teams of investigators conducted randomized controlled trials (RCT) at their own site to evaluate the effectiveness of bariatric surgery compared to medical/lifestyle management of type 2 diabetes. Each study followed subjects for a duration of about 1 - 3 years. Following this, a consortium was created to pool data and continue to follow study participants. This early collaboration of the 4 groups of investigators was supported by Industry sponsors (Ethicon, Inc and Medtronic-MITG). Now, the investigators have successfully received a grant from the NIH, as the sole supporter of continued observational follow-up of study participants.\n\nThe continuing aim of this study is to combine data from the 4 studies and follow the original randomized subjects for an additional 5 years of follow-up. The purpose of the study is to determine the longer term durability and effectiveness of bariatric surgery compared to medical/lifestyle intervention on the treatment of type 2 diabetes.",
          "detailedDescription": "The four investigative groups initiated their individual RCT's at their respective sites to evaluate the effectiveness of bariatric surgery compared to multidisciplinary medical and lifestyle management of diabetes and body weight. The original trials were each designed to assess feasibility over a relatively short duration of follow-up (1-3 years). Individually, each trial lacked the sample size and duration of follow-up to meaningfully inform clinical decision making. Together, with the funding provided by the NIH for longer follow-up, the Consortium trial can provide a unique national resource to address timely and unanswered clinical questions related to the durability of these alternative management approaches in patients with T2D and obesity. Together, participants from these studies represent the largest cohort with diabetes (one third having a BMI \\<35 kg/m2) ever to undergo randomized assignment to bariatric surgical procedure vs. medical/lifestyle intervention."

Up to 396 adults with overweight or obesity and type 2 diabetes will be randomized to either 1) intervention, or 2) usual care. The intervention arm will participate in the WW program modified for people with T2D including weekly Virtual Workshops and use of the WW App plus FreeStyle Libre 2 continuous glucose sensors. The WW program is a widely available, commercial weight management program that encourages healthy habits in the areas of food, activity, mindset, and sleep, with topics specific to diabetes. Participants in the usual care arm will receive their normal, usual care from their healthcare providers in addition to a session with a Registered Dietician at baseline. All participants will participate in the collection of patient-reported outcomes at baseline and at 6 and 12 months."

          "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to test whether the combination of two safe immune therapies called abatacept and nasal insulin can preserve pancreas function in recently-diagnosed type 1 diabetes. When type 1 diabetes is first diagnosed, the pancreas is still able to make small amounts of insulin, which helps control glucose levels. Preserving pancreas function can make glucose control easier and reduce the need to use injected insulin.\n\nParticipants will be asked to inject abatacept under their skin once per week and inhale nasal insulin or nasal placebo using a spray for 10 consecutive days initially and twice per week thereafter. The treatment period is for 48 weeks, with another 48-week follow-up period.",
          "detailedDescription": "Type 1 diabetes is caused by an immune attack on insulin-producing beta cells of the pancreas that impairs their ability to make insulin to control blood glucose levels. When diabetes is diagnosed, the pancreas is usually still able to make some insulin, but not enough to meet the body's needs. Over time, continued immune attack further decreases insulin production until after one to two years it is very low or undetectable. When type 1 diabetes is diagnosed, treatments that stop the immune attack may preserve residual beta-cell function. This decreases the requirement for injected insulin and improves glucose control. However, so far, immune therapies have not been shown to prevent ongoing loss of beta-cell function. In this clinical trial, two safe immune therapies called abatacept and nasal insulin will be used together to test if the combination can better preserve the function of beta cells to make insulin after diagnosis. If this occurs, it will be relatively simple to develop this treatment for routine use in recently-diagnosed people and to test whether it prevents high-risk individuals progressing to need insulin injections. This trial will also provide research samples to improve our understanding of how type 1 diabetes develops and how abatacept and nasal insulin might affect this process. The new knowledge created from studying these samples will improve our ability to use abatacept and nasal insulin to preserve pancreas function in type 1 diabetes."

          "briefSummary": "Poor heart health puts Black women at risk for a shorter life with more illness than people of any other non-indigenous racial group. We will refine and conduct a randomized, wait-list controlled trial of Inspire HER (a heart health lifestyle intervention for Black women that provides health education, physical activity, and social resources). We will also compare Inspire HER and Black Impact (a heart health intervention for Black men) data to study how women and men respond differently to stress. This trial aligns with American Heart Association's pledge to address heart health equity through new interventions that consider the person and the circumstances with which they live.",
          "detailedDescription": "Poor heart health puts Black women at risk for a shorter life with more illness than people of any other non-indigenous racial group. Yet, few studies have focused on improving heart health in Black women. Our team built and studied a 24-week program called Black Impact for Black men with less than ideal heart health. Black Impact provides 45 minutes of exercise and 45 minutes of healthy diet education and connects Black men with a health coach, fitness trainer, and community health worker. In the first study of Black Impact, Black men (n=74) had improved heart health equal to a 19% lower risk of death from heart disease. These men also reported less stress, improvement in being able to control their health, and fewer unmet social needs. Now, a study of Black Impact in 340 Black men is ongoing to understand how Black Impact works with respect to stress and heart health. Black women have reported a need for a similar heart health program. Based on feedback from Black women (n=56), we adapted Black Impact for Black women (Inspire HER). Thus, we propose to refine the Inspire HER program for Black women. Then, we will do a clinical trial of Inspire HER compared to routine living (usual care) in Black women with elevated heart health risk. We will find out if the Inspire HER program reduces heart health risk more than usual care. We will also assess how the Inspire HER program \"gets under the skin\" to affect the body's response to stress. Lastly, we will compare the response to stress between women of Inspire HER and men of Black Impact. Importantly, we expect this study will show promising improvements in heart health and risk. This Inspire HER trial will lay the foundation for larger future studies. Inspire HER, comparing data from Black Impact, may also help us understand how women and men in heart health programs respond differently to stress. This trial aligns with American Heart Association's pledge to address heart health equity through new interventions that consider the person and the circumstances with which they live."

          "briefSummary": "This observational study aims to measure movement behaviours and explore factors influencing these among Bahraini patients with type 2 diabetes.\n\nThe main objectives are:\n\n(i) Measure free-living physical activity and sedentary behaviour with an accelerometer device (ii) Examine associations between movement behaviours and anthropometric and diabetes-related biochemical/clinical parameters (iii) Examine associations between movement behaviours and psychological and environmental determinants that influence movement behaviours (iv) Assess the feasibility and acceptability of the physical activity assessment tools as part of routine clinical practice with clinicians and diabetic patients\n\nParticipants will be invited to wear an accelerometer device for seven days.",
          "detailedDescription": "In Bahrain, the number of people diagnosed with diabetes has risen from 9% at the start of the new millennium to 15% in 2022, and like any other country, it places a significant burden on the country's health system. People with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are more sedentary, do less physical activity (PA), have lower cardiovascular fitness levels and are at higher risk for comorbid conditions that may affect mobility (e.g., sarcopenia and diabetic foot ulcers) compared to people without diabetes. Regular aerobic physical activity benefits in this clinical population include reduced HbA1C, triglycerides, blood pressure, body fat, and insulin resistance. Understanding the PA and sedentary behaviour patterns of Bahraini adults with T2DM is an essential first step towards our long-term goal of planning and developing a physical activity intervention.\n\nA combination of self-efficacy and outcome expectations influence behaviour change, and it is important to understand the relationship between these in any specific T2DM population to identify appropriate interventions. Improving uptake and adherence to PA by people with T2DM also requires an understanding of any enablers and barriers.\n\nThis study aims to measure movement behaviours among Bahraini adult patients with T2DM using an accelerometer device and to examine associations with anthropometric and biochemical/clinical parameters, psychological and environmental determinants that influence these behaviours, and to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the PA assessment tools as part of standard clinical practice with clinicians and people with diabetes.\n\nThe study design will be observational and conducted at four specialist government diabetic clinics drawn from across the governorates of Bahrain. We aim to recruit 320 Bahraini adults 45-64 years old with controlled T2DM.\n\nParticipants will attend two visits seven days apart:\n\nVisit 1: Anthropometric measurements will be conducted. information on sociodemographic characteristics will be collected. Information on select clinical parameters will be collected from the medical record of each patient's last visit to the health centre for routine follow-up within the last four months; otherwise, these measurements will be ordered. Participants will complete questionnaires to investigate behavioural and environmental determinants of physical activity. Participants will be fitted with an accelerometer device (activPALTM) and advised to wear it for the next seven days, after which they should return for visit 2. Finally, each participant will receive an activity diary to complete each day.\n\nVisit 2: Participants will return the accelerometer and activity diary. They will also complete the same questionnaires of behavioural and environmental determinants which were administered in visit 1. Finally, participants will complete a utility questionnaire about the accelerometer."

The study will monitor the implementation itself and the clinical outcomes: clinical and functional status and quality of life.",
          "detailedDescription": "The study is a type 2 hybrid implementation effectiveness trial, whose objective is to simultaneously test the clinical intervention and the implementation strategy. The study will take place in 4 phases, the first being pre-implementation, whose objective is to gather information about local characteristics, barriers and facilitators, and constitute the implementation team. During the second phase, the implementation team will be responsible for structuring the actions for the implementation of the intervention, adapting it to the context defined in phase 1, developing strategies for the training of primary care workers. In phase 3, we will implement the intervention either using a software or a booklet for people with diabetes and we will monitor the participants' diabetes-related, functional and quality of life outcomes after the 12 weeks of intervention. Reach, adoption and implementation will be evaluated using the RE-AIM tool. In phase 4 - \\_maintenance - \\_the municipality will be responsible for maintaining, expanding and improving the changes achieved, promoting the sharing of experience with other public and private institutions, facilitating the diffusion of similar programs. Specifically in the phase 3, a randomized controlled trial will be performed with 356 patients with diabetic neuropathy. The participants will be randomly assigned into either a control group (recommended foot care by international consensus with no foot exercises) or an intervention group that will perform face to face exercises, supervised by physiotherapists for 12-weeks. The subjects will be evaluated in 2 different times to access the effect of the intervention: baseline and 12 weeks, for all outcomes. The following outcomes will be assessed in all times: (1) diabetic neuropathy symptoms by Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument, (2) range of motion of the ankle and first metatarsophalangeal joint, (3) fuzzy score of the neuropathy severity, (4) Time up and go, (5) hallux and toes strength (by a pressure plate measurement , (6) hallux strength (by the enhanced paper grip test),(7) ulcers and pre-ulcerative lesions and (8) quality of life (EQ-5D). The hypothesis of this study is that the intervention will reduce the symptoms of diabetic neuropathy, increase the strength of the foot muscles, decrease the severity of the diabetic neuropathy (fuzzy score), decrease the number of neuropathy symptoms, as well increase range of motion, functionality and quality of life."

          "briefSummary": "The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of date consumption on hedonic hunger and appetite hormones in individuals diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* Does date consumption reduce hedonic hunger in individuals with type 2 diabetes?\n* Does persimmon consumption change Ghrelin, GLP-1 and GIP concentrations in individuals with Type 2 diabetes?\n* Does persimmon consumption reduce HOMA-IR and HbA1c values in individuals with Type 2 diabetes?\n* Does consumption of persimmon reduce LDL cholesterol, total cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations in individuals with type 2 diabetes? To see the effects of date consumption on hedonic hunger and appetite hormones, the researchers will compare individuals with type 2 diabetes who consume 3 dates daily with individuals with type 2 diabetes who do not.\n\nParticipants:\n\n* Individuals in the intervention group will consume 3 (25 g) Baghdad dates (15 g CHO) daily as part of the breakfast meal, while individuals in the control group will not consume dates.\n* Three interviews will be conducted with patients.\n* A record of blood findings and questionnaires will be kept during these interviews.",
          "detailedDescription": "1. Study Design and Participants The sample of this randomised controlled clinical trial will consist of adult individuals with Type 2 diabetes who apply to Erzurum City Hospital Internal Medicine outpatient clinic. A control group will be formed with individuals with Type 2 diabetes in the same age group. Informed Voluntary Consent Form will be obtained from the individuals before starting the study. Power analysis was performed to determine the sample size. The study population was determined as 70 individuals with the G-power programme. In this randomised controlled study, individuals will be randomly assigned to the intervention and control groups using a computer generated list.\n2. Intervention and Control Groups Individuals who agree to participate in the study will be randomly assigned to the intervention and control groups. The study consists of three stages. The first interview will take place at week 0, the second interview at week 6 and the last interview at week 12. The control group will not be intervened by not giving any additional food and will be asked not to consume dates during the study. The intervention group will be informed at the first interview about which meal and in what quantity they will consume dates. Dates will be delivered to participants at baseline (6-week supply) and at week 6 of the study (6-week supply). Individuals in the intervention group will consume 3 (25 g) Baghdad dates (15 g CHO) daily as part of the breakfast meal. Individuals will be given weekly recording sheets to record their date consumption. The diaries will be collected fortnightly to ensure dates are consumed as directed (a photo of the diary will be requested via email or social media). Individuals will receive a fortnightly telephone reminder.\n3. Questionnaire Form Information such as socio-demographic characteristics, smoking and alcohol consumption status, health status, medication used in diabetes treatment, etc. will be obtained through a face-to-face questionnaire. Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) will be used for subjective hunger. The questionnaire form will also include the Food Power Scale for the assessment of hedonic hunger, the International Physical Activity Questionnaire short form (IPAQ-SF) for the assessment of physical activity levels and three-day Food Consumption Records for the assessment of food consumption.\n4. Anthropometric Measurements In the study, anthropometric measurements of individuals will be taken at 0. 6. and 12. weeks. Height will be measured with a stadiometer (SECA 213) with an accuracy of 0.1 cm with the feet side by side and the head in the Frankort plane. Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) (TanitaBC-730) will be used to evaluate body weight and body composition. The measurements will be performed by the researcher.\n5. Biochemical analyses Blood samples taken from the individuals at weeks 0 and 12 will be analysed in the Biochemistry Laboratory of Atatürk University Research Hospital. Fasting blood glucose, fasting blood insulin, HbA1c, Ghrelin, GLP-1, GIP total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglyceride analyses will be performed. Fasting blood glucose, fasting blood insulin, HbA1c, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglycerides are the tests routinely requested by the doctor. Blood samples for ghrelin, GLP-1 and GIP analyses will be collected and analysed separately in the laboratory. Fasting blood glucose and insulin values of individuals who will be used in homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) will be measured. Fasting and postprandial blood glucose will be measured with a glucometer at 0, 6 and 12 weeks of the study.\n\n   * Statistical analyses will be performed using SPSS version 22 software."

          "briefSummary": "Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus represents one of the most important health emergencies of this century Although it is known that insulin resistance is reversible and that type 2 diabetes mellitus is controllable with a change towards a healthy lifestyle, the population ignores these recommendations and continues with their unhealthy habits. Thus, the number of patients continues to grow exponentially, which leads to an increase in economic expenditure on health.

          "detailedDescription": "Researchers Dra. Sabina López Toledo (Responsible) Maria Cruz Pineda De la Cruz General objective To assess the adjuvant effects of flaxseed consumption (14 gr of flaxseed) on biochemical markers (glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL cholesterol and HDL cholesterol) in adult patients (30 to 70 years) with type 2 diabetes mellitus, who attend the Nutrition outpatient clinic of the Regional Hospital in Oaxaca.\n\nSpecific objectives\n\n1. To describe the sociodemographic variables (age, sex, occupation, marital status) of adult patients (30 to 70 years) with type 2 diabetes, who attend the Nutrition outpatient clinic of the Regional Hospital in Oaxaca.\n2. Describe the clinical characteristics (time of disease evolution, type of treatment, control and comorbidities) of adult patients (30 to 70 years) with type 2 diabetes who attend the Nutrition outpatient clinic of the Regional Hospital in Oaxaca.\n3. Assess the biochemical parameters (glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL cholesterol and HDL cholesterol) of adult patients (30 to 70 years) with type 2 diabetes who attend the Nutrition outpatient clinic of the Regional Hospital in Oaxaca, prior to consuming flaxseed and three months after regular consumption of flaxseed.\n4. Apply a nutritional intervention to two groups: Group A) Teaching about the healthy eating plate and Group B) Teaching about the healthy eating plate and indicating the consumption of flaxseed.\n5. To evaluate the effect of flaxseed consumption on biochemical markers (glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin, total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL cholesterol and HDL cholesterol of adult patients (30 to 70 years) suffering from type 2 diabetes, who attend the Nutrition outpatient clinic of the Regional Hospital in Oaxaca.\n6. To analyze the most effective possible combinations (pharmacological + non-pharmacological) for the treatment of adult patients (30 to 70 years) suffering from type 2 diabetes, who attend the Nutrition outpatient clinic of the Regional Hospital in Oaxaca.\n\nJustification Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus represents one of the most important health emergencies of this century. It is estimated that in 2019 there were already 463 million people with diabetes mellitus worldwide and that this figure may increase to 578 million by 2030 and 700 million by 2030. million by 2045. A state of hyperglycemia is associated with acute and chronic complications, in both cases affecting the cardiovascular system, mainly the blood vessels and consequently the entire body, but mainly the eyes, kidneys, arteriovenous systems and peripheral nerves. Although it is known that insulin resistance is reversible and that type 2 diabetes mellitus is controllable with a change towards a healthy lifestyle, the population ignores these recommendations and continues with their unhealthy habits. Thus, the number of patients continues to grow exponentially, which leads to an increase in economic expenditure on health. This is why non-pharmacological measures are sought that favor the reduction of glycemia in patients with Diabetes Mellitus where the consumption of functional foods is a good alternative for the treatment of this chronic disease. Flaxseed is a food characterized by its nutritional properties, highlighting its content of alpha linoleic acid, flax lignans, and secoisolariciresinol diglucosides. The latter have antioxidant, lipid-lowering and hypoglycemic effects, which makes it an excellent option as a functional treatment for type 2 diabetes.\n\nDescription of the procedures Patients who sign the informed consent will be assigned a group according to the following: if they have an even number in their file, they will be part of the control group (A), and if they have an odd number, they will be part of the intervention group B.\n\nGroup A. They will be given a verbal instruction to continue with the treatment established by the treating physician, and they will be given nutritional guidance with the help of the healthy eating plate.\n\nGroup B. They will be given verbal instructions to continue with the treatment established by the treating physician, they will be given nutritional guidance with the help of the healthy eating plate and they will be given a leaflet with written instructions and photos on how to consume flaxseed and its benefits.\n\nPhase 3. Flaxseed administration The researchers will purchase, package and provide the flaxseed powder to the members of group B. The flaxseed will be delivered in packages with 16 gr of ground flaxseed each, which will be given to the patients for daily consumption (one 8 gr spoonful of flaxseed in the morning snack and one 10 gr spoonful of flaxseed in the morning snack)."

          "detailedDescription": "Gastroparesis is a burdensome condition that is caused by abnormal motor function of the stomach that results in delayed gastric emptying. It typically manifests with bloating, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and even excessive weight loss and dehydration. The most common causes of gastroparesis are idiopathic, diabetic, medication-induced or iatrogenic (postsurgical) gastroparesis.\n\nAfter ruling out mechanical obstruction as an underlying cause of gastroparesis using endoscopy or computed tomography, further assessment includes gastric emptying studies by scintigraphy to confirm the presence of delayed gastric emptying. Severity of symptoms and impact on health-related quality of life can be assessed using the Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index (GCSI) and Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index (GIQLI).\n\nManagement of gastroparesis includes assessment of nutritional status, correction of fluid, electrolytes and nutritional deficiencies, symptomatic therapy, management of the underlying cause of gastroparesis, and improvement of gastric emptying. Implantation of a gastric neurostimulation device is a surgical option to improve gastric emptying in patients with medication-refractory gastroparesis. Enterra® system is a gastric electrical stimulation that sends mild pulses through leads implanted in the stomach wall that stimulate gastric smooth muscles and nerves in order to improve symptoms and quality of life.\n\nAim of this registry trial is to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of laparoscopic gastric pacemaker implantation for electrical stimulation (Enterra® system). Primary endpoints of the study are symptom severity, health-related quality of life, and frequency of hospitalization before and after pacemaker implantation, perioperative complication rate, and cost effectiveness.\n\nIt is hypothesized that implantation of the Enterra systems leads to a significant improvement of symptoms as well as an increase in health-related quality of life in patients with gastroparesis."

Adult/youth participant dyads will be enrolled across 5 Ojibwe tribal communities. Consenting participant dyads will be randomized into one of two groups:\n\nGroup A: begin the intervention program immediately; Group B (waitlist): begin the intervention program in 2 years.\n\nBoth groups will complete assessments with study staff at baseline, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months to assess HbA1c, cholesterol, blood pressure (adults), biometric measures, and psychosocial and behavioral outcomes (adults and youth).\n\nThe 14-lesson intervention program will be delivered in the participant's home by local Family Health Coaches over a 6-month period.\n\nUpon completion of the intervention, participants may also be invited to participate in a \"Ripple Effects Mapping\" (REM) session for discussions, and mapping of the intervention effects.",
          "detailedDescription": "Together Overcoming Diabetes (TOD) is a culturally tailored, family-based type 2 diabetes management and preventive intervention. The program activates family and cultural practices that encourage healthy diets and physical activities, promotes coping skills for dealing with stress, and reconnects families via a home-based intervention taught by American Indian (AI) paraprofessional Family Health Coaches.\n\nEvaluation of TOD for this trial will happen via Community Based Participatory Research (CBPR). The study team will enroll \"target\" adult caregivers diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and their youth, ages 10-16 years at enrollment, with the goal of tapping motivational reciprocity between the two generations. The work involves collaboration with five Ojibwe tribal communities in the midwestern U.S. to implement a randomized controlled study with a wait-list design respectful of cultural norms of inclusion.\n\nThe study will evaluate effectiveness of the intervention on adult physiological (primary outcome = HbA1c), behavioral, and mental health and children's psychosocial, familial, behavioral and physiological risk and protective factors for diabetes. The research will also identify stress-coping mechanisms that mediate the impact of the intervention on health. A novel collaborative, qualitative evaluation technique will map potential \"ripple effects\" of the intervention within families and communities. If effective, the intervention will promote dissemination and scaling with tribal health coaches, community involvement, and stakeholder (health providers, health and human service agencies) input."

          "briefSummary": "Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is a major public health problem with significant socioeconomic implications due to its increased prevalence. Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the most frequent complication in DM patients and remains the leading cause of legal blindness in working-age populations (Yau et al., 2012). Differentiating patients with higher vs low risk of progression to vision-threatening complications is of paramount importance for an efficient managing of the disease to prevent vision disability.\n\nPREDICTION is a longitudinal prospective clinical study in DMT2 patients with a higher risk of progression to explore possible imaging, functional and systemic biomarkers of progression, using non-invasive methods, commonly applied in the clinical practice. Investigating the retinal vascular network (vessel density metrics with Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography) will allow a better understanding of the evolution of capillary closure and ischemia, two main risk factors for DR worsening.",
          "detailedDescription": "Patients with Mild to Severe NPDR (ETDRS DRSS 43-53) often progress to PDR and/or CI-DME (ETDRS Report). However, it is unclear which patients in this group are likely to progress. Previous studies have shown that diabetic macular ischemia (DMI) is a risk factor for progression of DR. This study aims to correlate baseline OCTA metrics with visual function and identify risk factors for progression from NPDR to PDR and/or CI-DME."

The hospital environment, especially the ICU, is reported as a significant cause of anxiety for patients. Comfort is a holistic, subjective and multidimensional concept that is affected by physical, environmental, social and psycho-spiritual contexts and changes over time and space. Comfort in intensive care is often associated with pain relief and end-of-life care. Assessment tools have been developed to measure patient comfort in the ICU, including levels of pain, delirium, and sedation. This work; Patients who are monitored in intensive care under high-flow and oxygen are treated with a mixture of lavender, thyme and eucalyptus oil (20 ml; lavender oil 5 drops, thyme oil 4 drops, eucalyptus oil 3 drops and 20 ml almond oil) twice a day for three days. This study was conducted to determine the effect of aromatherapy massage applied for a total of 30 minutes on some physiological parameters, pain, anxiety and intensive care comfort of the patients."

The study aim to evaluate the effectiveness of IAREP on cognition, metabolic health, physical health, and psychological health in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus population.",
          "detailedDescription": "Purpose: A single-site, non-randomized, prospective clinical trial is proposed to determine the significance of an Intensive Aerobic and Resistance Exercise Program on cognitive function, metabolic health, and inflammatory conditions in individuals with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who present with high-risk and low-risk cognitive impairment.\n\nBackground and Significance: T2DM is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among adults worldwide, with approximately 5 million diabetes-related deaths accounting for 12.8% of all-cause mortality in 2015. The prevalence of T2DM in Asia is on the rise, with an anticipated increase from 78 million in 2015 to 140 million by 2040. Asia, therefore, is emerging as the \"diabetes epicenter\" due to rapid economic development, urbanization, and nutrition transition. T2DM is a complex disease with environmental and genetic contributions that cause many severe complications in middle-aged and older adults, including a higher susceptibility to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. The prevalence of cognitive impairment in T2DM ranges from 21.8% to 67.5% worldwide in all adults. Our previous study developed a risk stratification score (RSS) to quickly screen the T2DM population for high-risk or low-risk cognitive impairment. Exercise intervention plays an important role in T2DM management. Aerobic exercise has multiple benefits to metabolic functions, including increasing cardiovascular fitness, improving skeletal muscle capillary density, and reducing body fat. Resistance training is considered a promising intervention for reversing the loss of muscle function and deterioration of muscle structure associated with aging. Intervention strategies, such as the proposed combined aerobic and resistance training program, will provide a guideline to prescribe exercise dosage for individuals with T2DM who are at risk of cognitive impairment.\n\nMethods \\& Research Plan: The study will recruit 80 subjects, who will be assigned to either the exercise intervention group or the non-exercise control group according to their availability. The intervention group will receive a 12-week Intensive Aerobic and Resistance Exercise Program (IAREP), while the control group will not have IAREP exercise and will continue to receive usual care from Jurong National University Polyclinics. The primary outcomes include cognition, metabolic health, inflammatory conditions, and physical and psychological health."

          "briefSummary": "Diabetes mellitus is a common chronic disease with a huge socioeconomic burden worldwide. Type 1 Diabetes(T1D) accounts for nearly 95% of diabetes in pediatric age and a lifelong dependence on exogenous insulin. Its diagnosis is based on symptoms and/or autoantibodies, both identified too late to avoid the disease progress. Ideally, children should be screened whilst assymptomatic, when there is endogenous insulin production, but C-peptide and beta-cell function are starting to decline. Early diagnosis would allow interventions capable of preventing disease progress and/or to preserve beta-cell function, ultimately delaying/avoiding insulin dependence. Given their association with pathogenesis of diabetes, Extracellular Vesicles have emerged as potential biomarkers for diagnosis and progression of diabetes. This project proposes the development of a non-invasive biomarker of preclinical T1D, based on miRNA characterization in urine, allowing a timely identification of children that can benefit from preventive therapies and, in the future, to cure T1D."

Data from patients with T1D who start(ed) with the DBLG1 between may-01 2022 up to and including August-01 2023 will be analyzed. Data will be collected during clinical routine follow-up from electronic medical records, questionnaires, standard of care laboratory tests and CGM-data. Baseline data from before start (up to -12 months) of the DBLG1 system and follow-up data at 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24 months will be analyzed. There are no medical interventions, nor extra visits or laboratory tests planned outside normal clinical routine. Glycemic control and patient-reported outcomes during follow-up will be compared with glycemic control and patient-reported outcome data at baseline."

The study will focus on people with type 2 diabetes living in specified vulnerable zip codes.",
          "detailedDescription": "The study procedures will commence with an initial screening to confirm participants' eligibility based on the inclusion criteria, followed by the signing of Informed Consent forms. Baseline data including medical records and quality of life questionnaires will be collected. A continuous glucose monitoring (CGM - Dexcom 7) will be inserted; a sport wristband (Fitbit Sense 2) will be provided; and environmental sensor for home data collection, will be distributed and set up in the home setting by the participant. The study will require two CGMs (10 days for each CGM). The 1st CGM will be inserted during the initial visit to the clinic. After 10 days, participants will return to the clinic, and the 2nd CGM will be inserted. The investigators will also send text reminders two days before the scheduled 2nd CGM insertion. Communication with participants will be maintained via text messages, and for those who request it, virtual meetings can be arranged (via HIPAA-protected Zoom). The subjects will be provided with a mailing envelope with postage to return the 2nd CGM, Fitbit Sense 2 and environmental sensors. If the subject is returning to clinic within the next week, they can instead return the devices during their visit, and a member of the study team will meet them in the clinic.\n\nThroughout the study, there will be integration of real-time data from various sources, including electronic health records, wearables, and environmental sensor. The environmental sensor is a climate sensor called Airthings. The Airthings View Plus is an advanced indoor air quality monitor that tracks various environmental parameters to ensure healthy indoor air conditions. It features sensors for radon, particulate matter (PM2.5), carbon dioxide (CO2), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), humidity, temperature, and air pressure. This monitor is connected to Wi-Fi, allowing real-time access to air quality data via a smartphone app. The device is designed for ease of use with an eInk display for clear visibility of air quality readings and simple setup instructions. The Airthings View Plus is battery-operated with an option for USB power, providing flexibility in how and where the device can be used within a home."

          "briefSummary": "The purpose of this study is to test the Share plus intervention aimed at improving the use of data sharing between people with diabetes and their care partners in order to maximize the benefits of continuous glucose monitoring.\n\nHypothesis: Compared to the control group, persons with diabetes enrolled in the Share plus intervention group will experience clinically significant improvements in time-in-range (TIR) (\\>5%) at 12- and 24-weeks into the study, and improvement on diabetes distress. Care partners enrolled in the Share plus intervention group will experience lower diabetes distress at 12- and 24-weeks into the study.",
          "detailedDescription": "Older adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D) have an increased risk of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia that can result in grave health consequences, such as seizures, falls, and myocardial infarctions. Care partners (e.g., spouses, friends) regularly become part of the diabetes care team to assist in self-management as a person with diabetes ages. A technological advancement that is available to people with diabetes and their care partners to address harmful hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia is to use continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), with a data-sharing app that allows the older adult with T1D and their care partner (dyad) to see glucose data on their smart-phones and to receive an alert before hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia occurs. Our long-term goal is to leverage the full potential of technology and care partner interventions to optimize the support that care partners can provide for effective glucose management in older adults with T1D. Our overall objective is to test an intervention, called Share plus, aimed at improving the use of data sharing between persons with diabetes and their care partners in order to maximize the benefits of CGM. The Share plus intervention provides instruction to current CGM users about how to set up the data sharing app, dyadic communication and problem solving, and how to establish a data-sharing action plan for older adults with T1D and their care partners.\n\nOur central hypothesis is that Share plus will result in increased time-in-range and decreased diabetes distress for both persons with diabetes (PWD) and their care partners (CPs) compared to the control group. The rationale for this pilot study is that demonstrating the efficacy of Share plus will provide new opportunities for a clinically useful approach to increase time in glucose range and decrease diabetes distress among older adults with T1D and their care partners. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) evaluate feasibility, usability, and acceptability of the Share plus intervention compared to the control group receiving data sharing with diabetes self-management education, 2) evaluate the effect of Share plus intervention on time-in-range and Diabetes Distress, and 3) explore the differences between groups in PWD and CP dyadic appraisal and coping, quality of life, diabetes self-care and care partner burden. To test our central hypothesis, we will conduct a pilot randomized 1:1 control trial in older adults with T1D already using CGM (N=80 dyads) in a telehealth format where the intervention group will receive data sharing and Share plus and the control group will receive diabetes self-management education and assistance setting up the data sharing app. The trial will include a 12-week active intervention to determine a change in primary outcomes and a 12-week observation-only phase to determine maintenance of changes. The research proposed in this application is innovative because it provides a needed and substantive departure from the status quo by bringing a dyadic perspective of T1D management using data-sharing technology."

          "briefSummary": "The primary aim of this randomized controlled trial is to examine the effects of a 4-week high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and time-restricted eating (TRE) intervention on cardiometabolic biomarkers in adolescents and young adults.",
          "detailedDescription": "As of 2015, an estimated 2 billion individuals were overweight (body mass index \\[BMI\\] ≥ 25 kg/m2), and one-third of them were obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2). Obesity has become a serious health concern due to its related comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D). While adolescents and young adults are considered low risk for the development of CVD, individuals with obesity are still at a greater risk of CVD development than individuals without obesity. Changes to dietary and fitness habits are currently the first-line recommendations for preventing weight gain and improving cardiometabolic health in adolescents and young adults.\n\nCaloric restriction (CR), which involves reducing caloric intake by up to 50% of normal daily calorie intake, is a common dietary intervention approach for weight management and improving cardiometabolic health in adolescents and adults with obesity.9 However, studies have shown that CR is hard to maintain, and individuals tend to regain the weight after the intervention is completed. Time-restricted eating (TRE) has been proposed as an alternative to calorie restriction (CR). TRE, a type of short-term fasting, is defined as periods of no caloric intake followed by periods of ad libitum (as much as desired) caloric intake. The fact that TRE does not intentionally limit energy intake, whereas CR does, could make it more appealing to individuals in terms of adherence, acceptability, and efficacy. TRE is an effective strategy in reducing body fat percentage and waist circumference in adolescents and adults with obesity.\n\nMoreover, high-intensity interval training (HIIT), which involves repeating short periods of intense activity followed by low-intensity breaks, has been shown to be effective in improving cardiometabolic health (including lipids, blood pressure, and insulin sensitivity) in adults with obesity compared to other traditional exercises. In addition to its benefits on cardiometabolic health, previous studies have suggested that HIIT can be a time-efficient strategy to enhance body composition and cardiopulmonary fitness in adults with obesity.1\n\nHowever, it is unknown if TRE or HIIT will produce a greater improvement in cardiometabolic health. Therefore, the goal of this study is to examine the independent effect of a 4-week TRE and HIIT intervention on cardiometabolic biomarkers in youth and young adults."

This study will specifically target adults aged 50 years and older of Asian or Asian-descent with diagnosed type 2 diabetes, residing in San Francisco. The goal of the study is to demonstrate the utility of pharmacy students in a community setting on chronic disease management through patient-specific education and interventions. The aims of this study are to compare glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes who receive continuous assessment and non-pharmacological counseling from student pharmacists versus those who do not. Specifically, this study will evaluate:\n\n1. The impact of student pharmacist assessments and personalized recommendations on diet, exercise, and adherence to treatment regimens, and their lasting effects on blood glucose control.\n2. If participants perceived any value and effect of student pharmacist involvement in managing chronic diseases."

It is believed that these errors will be small and will not exceed 15-20 min in duration; (3) Determine how safe this device is; (4) In a survey given to subjects and other subjects after the study, to assess satisfaction and convenience vs standard MDI; (5) Assess accuracy of the glucose sensor; and (6) Compare how well subjects' glucose is controlled with the new device compared to the comparison (control) period in which subjects use standard MDI, during which the injections will be far away from the CGM.",

Compare use of the PDT CGM injection port with standard site-rotated MDI injections; test potential insulin incompatibility of long-and short-acting insulin.\n\nExperimental Protocol: Approval will be obtained from OHSU IRB after the IDE is cleared by FDA. Subjects with T2D (n=18 in total) using MDI will be recruited from Dr. Castle's OHSU Diabetes Clinic.\n\nInformed consent and insulin regimen: Informed consent and signing will precede a screening visit which will include history, physical exam, complete blood count, electrolytes, BUN, creatinine, liver panel, calcium and phosphorus. Those who pass will be pseudo-randomized to injecting insulin through the sensing port during days 2-4 and crossing over to standard subcutaneous injections during days 5-7 or vice-versa. Prior to starting insulin pen usage, a visit will be scheduled with a diabetes research staff member or a certified diabetes educator to demonstrate the proper pen usage and port mating. Before the study begins, Dr. Castle will modify the MDI regimen to include aspart or rapid aspart insulin (Fiasp) before meals and long-acting (degludec) at bedtime. Dr. Henrik Bengsston from Novo has clarified that degludec insulin (neutral pH) is compatible with Novo fast-acting preparations.\n\nStudy Goals: (1) Demonstrate that CGM accuracy over 7d during injections via the CGM-MDI port is not inferior to accuracy during remote SC injections; (2) Demonstrate that algorithmic compensation for the dilution artifact will maintain sensor accuracy in the hour after boluses; (3) Validate the safety of the novel CGM-MDI port; (4) assess port longevity, and (5) assess subject satisfaction with port usage.\n\nIn addition, there is a possibility that degludec insulin remaining in the SC depot will alter the pharmacodynamics of the aspart given the next day. The study design will allow investigators to address this possibility by evaluating post-prandial glycemic control on Day 7 after the first meal: in 50% of cases, the prior degludec will have been given via the port into the same SC depot; in the other 50%, the degludec will have been given at a distant SC site by standard injection.\n\nSkin Issues: Allergic Skin reactions, Infection, Dislodgement: It is now recognized that allergic reactions to sensor adhesives are common (in as many as 35% of sensor users). For this reason, the acrylate adhesive will not contain IBOA, ethyl cyanoacrylate, or colophonium. As a further precaution against contact dermatitis, a breathable barrier film will be placed under the device (A layer of IV Prep (Smith and Nephew) will first be placed on clean, dry skin). At study's end, the subjects will be asked about surrounding redness, itching, or pain, and the site will be observed and photo-graphed (without identifying information) after device removal. To reduce the risk of bacterial inoculation, each subject will prepare the septum roof with an alcohol wipe, letting it dry prior to injection. Since many people struggle with keeping devices attached to their skin, each subject will have a Grifgrips overlay with a hole in center, placed over their ports.\n\nCLINICAL STUDY, Day 1: Each subject will arrive in the fasted state unless BG at home prior to travel is less than 90 mg/dl, in which case subject will take 15 g of carbohydrate (and recheck BG) before traveling to the clinic. After arrival at OHSU, each subject will have two CGM's placed widely apart, a Dexcom G6 and a PDT CGM-MDI port. A catheter will be placed in a forearm vein for blood withdrawal and kept warm (arterialized) either with a hand warming box set to 55° C or with warmed towels. Time 0 is set at the first bite of the first meal (approximately 1000 h). Both meals will be high carbohydrate mixed meals consisting of 9 kcal/kg and half-ml arterialized venous blood samples will be obtained at time 0 and every 10 minutes through the remainder of the study, and analyzed for whole blood glucose using a YSI 2300 glucose analyzer. The first insulin injection will be administered by a staff member via the sensing port (teaching demonstration); the second will be given by the subject, with staff supervision. Each injection will be given just prior to the first bite of the meal. The second meal (same composition) will be given at minute 210. At minute 420, the IV catheter will be removed, the in-clinic experiment terminated, and the subject discharged (BG will be checked and a snack given if needed prior to travel home). The third meal of the day will be taken at home.\n\nDays 2-6: To give insulin, subjects will use either use the sensing port or remote SC sites according to the pseudo-randomization schedule ('pseudo-randomization' defined as 50% of subjects start at home with standard injections and 50% start with port injections). Each subject, regardless of randomization, will give 11 injections through the port and 12 via the standard subcutaneous route. Subjects will use the Dexcom and BG data to manage their diabetes (experimental CGM data will not be visible to subjects). Subjects will measure BG with a Contour Next meter and strips (supplied) before each meal, 1.5 hours after each meal, at bedtime, and whenever symptoms dictate. Subjects will keep a record of symptoms, carbohydrate intake, and insulin doses, and will be encouraged to call research staff with questions or concerns. A provision will be made for possible port occlusion detection: In the case of persistent hyperglycemia (over 250 mg/dl) during port usage, unexplained by dietary choices, subjects will be asked to given injections by the standard route instead and phone the research staff for additional guidance.\n\nDay 7: The in-clinic protocol will be the same as Day 1, except that the sensing port and the Dexcom CGM will already be in place. After the study, all devices will be removed. The research staff will assess the skin site by (1) photodocumentation (avoiding identifying marks such as tattoos) and (2) use of the Draize scale to quantify inflammation.\n\nUser Experience: At study's end, each subject will be asked to answer the Insulin Delivery Satisfaction Survey, a validated 18-question survey developed by Polonsky and Fisher (Polonsky, Fisher et al. 2015)."

          "briefSummary": "Only 2% of Americans meet the recommended levels of whole grain consumption, despite its association with reduced risk of type 2 diabetes. This study aims to assess if consumers with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes can be encouraged to switch from buying refined grain products to whole grain products when shopping for groceries online. The study will use personalized marketing strategies, with or without discounts which adjust based on purchasing behavior, to promote whole grain consumption.",
          "detailedDescription": "The overall objective of this study is to determine if behaviorally informed marketing strategies or those same strategies plus dynamically adapted financial incentives can prompt consumers with prediabetes or diabetes to switch from refined to whole grain products when grocery shopping online. The specific aims of the study are:\n\nAim 1: To demonstrate the feasibility of conducting a randomized controlled trial (RCT) via an online grocery delivery platform and to refine mechanism-based marketing nudges and incentives based on user insights. The overall objective of this aim is to customize the online grocery store experience to align with the needs of the consumers while also supporting the objectives of the two intervention arms outlined in Aim 2. Customizations will include displaying whole grains (e.g., whole wheat bread, brown rice) at the top of the study's online grocery store, featuring whole grain banner displays, and offering product swaps to highlight whole grain alternatives. Additionally, the study team will ensure that all refined grain items have corresponding whole grain options, to the extent possible. To evaluate the platform's usability and gather insights for refining the interventions, the study team will recruit 9 participants to test the customized online grocery store. Participants will provide feedback on the online shopping environment and whole grain options in an end-of-study survey. This feedback will be used to refine the marketing nudge interventions for Aim 2.\n\nAim 2: To test whether behaviorally informed marketing strategies or those same strategies plus dynamically adapted financial incentives can prompt consumers with prediabetes or diabetes to switch from buying refined grain products to whole grain products when grocery shopping online. Enrolled participants will be randomized to one of three intervention arms: 1) control (no intervention), 2) marketing nudges, or 3) marketing nudges + dynamically adapted financial incentives. Participants will select groceries from the study's online grocery store, and the orders will be delivered to their homes via a third-party delivery service. The first two weeks will serve as a baseline period for data collection. Starting in Week 3, participants in intervention arms 2 and 3 will be exposed to marketing nudges promoting whole grains for 8 weeks. Participants in the third intervention arm will additionally receive personalized financial incentives with individual incentive amounts optimized weekly based on prior whole grain purchasing behavior and engagement. In a typical healthy eating incentive study, all participants would get the same incentive amount each week. An innovative aspect of this study is to dynamically adapt the incentive, so each person experiences a personalized offering of incentives each week based on their whole grain shopping habits in prior weeks. This means participants who did not buy a whole grain item in response to a smaller incentive in a prior week may receive a larger incentive than participants who did purchase whole grains when offered the smaller incentive. This will not be gameable since it will not be apparent to participants a priori. This approach enables us to mimic current retailer practices, rather than more outdated strategies that provide the same incentive weekly.\n\nAim 3: To examine whether whole grain purchasing behaviors have become habitual and persist after the marketing nudges and dynamically adapted financial incentives cease. The overall objective of this aim is to explore the potential for marketing strategies and dynamically adapted financial incentives to create lasting changes in grocery shopping habits, specifically by examining whether participants continue purchasing whole grain products once the intervention has ended. Participants will be followed for an additional 8 weeks post-intervention to track their online grocery shopping behavior in the absence of the marketing nudges and financial incentives. During this period, participants will continue to shop through the study's online grocery store and have their groceries delivered to them through a third-party delivery service. In addition, for the first 4 weeks of follow-up, they will continue to receive their weekly $10 incentive if they shop in the study's online grocery store. At the conclusion of the study, participants will receive a $25 incentive for completing a survey assessing the intervention's salience, their acceptance of whole grains, and any remaining barriers to switching to whole grains."

These recalcitrant wounds are difficult to manage and pose a heavy economic burden. Photobiomodulation (low level laser) is used for acceleration of wound healing. The current study is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of B-cure laser, a home-use low-level laser device, for acceleration of diabetic foot ulcer healing over standard treatment.",

The patient's wound will be evaluated every 2 weeks. Adverse events will be documented. The study hypothesis is that B-Cure laser treatments as an adjunct therapy to standard treatment, applied, at home, by the patient or personal care-giver, can accelerate diabetic foot ulcers healing compared to standard treatment alone."

Each week, participants will engage in 2 activities: an in-person Wellness Session and an at-home cooking experience using ingredients provided at the Wellness Session.\n\nThe study will examine the pre-post difference in overall diet quality, dermal carotenoid levels, physical activity, body composition, and glycemic measures among at-risk black adolescent girls and their caregivers. Investigators hypothesize that after the program, participants' diets will be higher in quality than before."

          "briefSummary": "The global rise in the prevalence of obesity paved the way for the increased prevalence of yet another obesity-related complication significant enough to be considered within the roster of major public health threats: non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). In this follow-up study, the investigators will attempt to decipher the natural history of hepatic steatosis among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) using state-of-the-art methods in a well-characterized Saudi cohort. The investigators aim also to validate existing biomarkers of disease severity and explore the pathogenesis of progressive disease using metabolic profiling technologies. A total of 1000 adult Saudi patients (males and females) with T2DM will be recruited. Those with co-morbidities, including hepatic decompensation, will be excluded. Participants will be followed three times for a total of 10 years/patient (Year 2, Year 5, and Year 10), and measures such as dietary evaluations, anthropometrics, and urine, stool, and blood examinations will be performed. Patients who develop NAFLD will be noted, and patterns/changes in the metabolic profile will be examined. For this specific grant (the first 2 years of the whole project), the investigators will be able to recruit the study cohort, do the baseline anthropometric, imaging, and biochemical measurements, and report the prevalence of NAFLD among patients with T2DM. This information will be the basis of subsequent follow-up and allow for validating potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. This project will be of high importance at the national level since it will create awareness in the local medical community of the current severity status of NAFLD in the kingdom and will be used as a tool to promote public health awareness in the community.",
          "detailedDescription": "The increased prevalence of obesity in both the developed and developing worlds paved the way to the increased prevalence of yet another obesity-related complication significant enough to be considered within the roster of major public health threats: non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). It has been estimated that approximately 20% to 30% of the adult population harbors NAFLD. It is also the most common liver pathology among children of developed countries. Unfortunately, despite the alarming figures, NAFLD remains largely underdiagnosed, probably because of its less aggressive nature and benign presentation compared with other liver diseases. Thus, it is apparent that NAFLD, being a precursor to more serious liver conditions such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, should be given equal, if not greater, clinical significance.\n\nAccumulating evidence has pointed to parallel clinical similarities between NAFLD and metabolic syndrome (MetS), the clustering of cardiovascular risk factors with insulin resistance as the common unifying factor. It is well established that persons with MetS are at greater risk of progressing to major chronic non-communicable diseases such as coronary artery disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Consequently, patients with T2DM are more likely to develop NAFLD. Obesity is acknowledged as one of the common denominators linking NAFLD, MetS, and T2DM, making dietary and lifestyle modifications the gold standard for the treatment of these clinical entities aside from pharmacotherapy that aims to improve insulin sensitivity. Therefore, it is important to better understand the intricate pathophysiology of NAFLD among patients with T2DM so that future interventions will be aimed at reversing complications.\n\nOur current knowledge of NAFLD in terms of prognosis and treatment is promising yet inconclusive, which means that further investigations using prospective approaches are required. Only recently was a consensus design for clinical trials and endpoints for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) reported. In this follow-up study, the investigators attempt to decipher the natural history of hepatic steatosis among patients with T2DM using state-of-the-art methods in a well-characterized Saudi cohort. Diabetes, and its related medical complications, have been identified as one of the priority areas of the National Plan for Science and Technology in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA)."

Nutritional factors are one of the important environmental factors in the occurrence and development of abnormal glucose metabolism. The medical nutritional treatment of diabetes is recommended as the cornerstone of diabetes treatment by various guidelines. With the development of nutrigenomics, it has been found that genes related to the absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion of various nutrients are related to diabetes. This study intends to conduct precision nutrition intervention for prediabetic patients based on nutritional genes, and evaluate the effectiveness and safety of these nutritional interventions."

EGP and GDR will be determined using established radioisotope methodology. The concentration of Hepatic Directed Vesicles (HDV) in the insulin lispro (LIS) infused during the clamp procedure will be varied such that the percentage of HDV-bound LIS will range from 0%, 1%, 10%, and 100%. Each participant will thus undergo four clamp procedures at the four different HDV levels. LIS will be infused at a constant dose (6 mU/m2/min) for each of the four procedures."

          "detailedDescription": "Both semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA), and tirzepatide, a glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP)/GLP-1RA, are currently approved treatments to control blood glucose in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and to lower weight in patients with obesity, with or without T2D. Obesity is a leading risk factor for the onset and the progression of heart failure (HF), especially HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Due to their potent weight-lowering action, semaglutide and tirzepatide have been recently evaluated in placebo-controlled trials conducted among persons with obesity and HFpEF, with or without T2D. These trials showed that semaglutide and tirzepatide reduced HF symptoms and HF events, compared to placebo.\n\nIn this new user, active comparator cohort study, the investigators will identify commercially insured adults (aged \\> 18 years) with T2D and HFpEF who initiated treatment with tirzepatide or semaglutide between June 1, 2022, and December 31, 2024. The investigators will retrieve information for each study participants using deidentified, longitudinal insurance claims data, including demographic characteristics, health plan enrollment status, inpatient and outpatient diagnoses, procedures, health care visits, hospitalizations, and pharmacy dispensing records.\n\nCohort entry is the day of initiation of tirzepatide or semaglutide. The follow-up starts on the day after cohort entry and continue until the occurrence of an outcome, discontinuation, switching, death, end of continuous health plan enrollment or end of the study period. Our primary outcome is a composite of hospitalization for HF or all-cause mortality.\n\nThe investigators will use propensity score adjustment to mitigate the risk of confounding. The investigators will calculate the number of events, incidence rates, and rate differences per 1000 person-years. Cox proportional hazard models will be used to estimate hazard ratios with their 95% confidence intervals."

          "briefSummary": "Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is associated with a high morbidity and mortality burden. There are limited pharmacological options available for the treatment of HFpEF. Exercise intolerance (EI) is the cardinal symptom of HFpEF, which manifests as dyspnea and fatigue. EI leads to functional deconditioning and reduced quality of life (QOL), both of which elevate risk of death and hospitalization in patients with HFpEF. Supervised exercised training is associated with improvements in exercise capacity and QOL in adults with HFpEF. However, supervised exercise has not been widely utilized for the treatment of HFpEF due to logistical and fiscal barriers.\n\nThis study will investigate the effects of a remote exercise training intervention on exercise capacity and skeletal muscle composition in patients with HFpEF, or those at risk for it. In addition, it will compare four different lifestyle interventions for their effects on exercise capacity.",
          "detailedDescription": "Heart failure (HF) portends substantial morbidity, mortality, and health care costs in the United States and the prevalence of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) relative to HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) has been increasing. HFpEF is associated with a high morbidity and mortality burden. There are limited pharmacological options available for the treatment of HFpEF. It is now recognized as a systemic, multi-organ, geriatric syndrome, with exercise intolerance (EI) and functional impairment as the key clinical manifestations. EI leads to functional deconditioning and reduced quality of life (QOL), both of which elevate risk of death and hospitalization in patients with HFpEF. Supervised exercised training is associated with improvements in exercise capacity and QOL in adults with HFpEF. However, supervised exercise has not been widely utilized for the treatment of HFpEF due to logistical and fiscal barriers.\n\nThis study will investigate the effects of a remote exercise training intervention on exercise capacity and skeletal muscle composition in patients with HFpEF, or those at risk for it. In addition, it will compare the effects of four different lifestyle interventions on exercise capacity.\n\nThe study will be carried out in two phases. In Phase I, 120 participants will undergo three months of home-based moderate-intensity continuous training (MCT), using tailored exercise videos on a mobile or tablet. Participants will also have weekly virtual meetings with a coach to discuss their progress. This will be followed by 3 months of no intervention, to assess the effects of detraining.\n\nIn Phase II (at the 6-month mark), 100 participants will be randomized to one of four extended training strategies for 3 months -(i) MCT alone; (ii) MCT plus resistance training; (iii) MCT plus weight loss, or (iv) MCT plus resistance training and weight loss.\n\nThe co-primary outcomes are (1) peak VO2, and (2) short physical performance battery score. In addition, participants will undergo CT chest/abdomen/pelvis at 3 months and 6 months to assess change in skeletal muscle composition with MCT"

Each dimension is rated on five levels of severity-ranging from no problems (Level 1) to extreme problems or inability to function (Level 5). A respondent's answers generate a five-digit health state profile that reflects their unique combination of responses (e.g., 12345), representing one of 3,125 possible health states.

          "detailedDescription": "The DiaTRUST trial is an open-label randomized controlled trial with a six-month trial period. The trial will be conducted at Steno Diabetes Center North Jutland. Patients with T2D on insulin therapy will be randomized (3:1:1) to an intelligent telemonitoring group (intervention), telemonitoring alone (control), or a usual care group (control). Both telemonitoring groups will use an insulin pen, an activity tracker, a CGM, and a smartphone application throughout the trial period. Hospital staff (lab technicians and nurses) will monitor the telemonitoring groups' data and contact the subjects by telephone repeatedly throughout the trial period. For patients assigned to the intelligent telemonitoring group, decision support algorithms will provide hospital staff with insight and data overviews to support treatment evaluation and adjustment throughout the trial. Furthermore, patients in the intelligent telemonitoring group will have access to algorithms through a smartphone application that can provide a risk assessment before bed of nocturnal hypoglycemia. The usual care group will use a blinded CGM for the first 20 days after inclusion, 20 days before the second visit to the trial site, and 20 days before the end of trial and will use a blinded insulin pen for the entire period. The usual care groups' data will not be monitored during the trial."

          "briefSummary": "Study is conducted to assess the prevalence and structure of comorbidity among patients undergoing abdominal surgery and produce the stratification of the risk of postoperative complications by identifying independent predictors for its development.",
          "detailedDescription": "Advances in modern anesthesiology have significantly reduced the risk of anesthesia compared to the last century, however, the level of perioperative hospital mortality of planned operations at the moment is on average about 0.5% (ISOS group, 2016). Weiser et al. (2016) estimated that more than 313 million adults worldwide are subject to surgery each year. Thus, the number of deaths may result in several million each year worldwide. However, the study of the mortality risk is associated with certain difficulties, because over the past half century, this figure has decreased a hundred times and the study requires studies that include a large number of participants.\n\nCurrent research focuses on other outcome criteria - postoperative complications. Thus, anesthetic risk often refers to the risk of postoperative complications. The frequency of these complications varies in a wide range, ranging from 3 to 18 % (Gawande AA, 1999, Kable AK, 2002, Malik OS, 2018). The differences in the data are explained by the lack of clear definitions and differences in the design of studies, but the fact that the development of postoperative complications increases the risk of death several times (ISOS group, 2016) can be considered undoubted. However, despite the importance of this issue, in modern literature there is no clear idea of what is considered a high risk and which of the patients corresponds to this category.\n\nUnderstanding whether a patient is at high risk is an essential task - it allows you to obtain meaningful informed consent of the patient, as well as to understand whether to apply strategies for the prevention of complications (targeted infusion therapy, protective respiratory support, especially monitoring in the postoperative period, etc.).\n\nAttempts at preoperative risk stratification have been made for many decades, some scales estimate the initial physical status (ASA scale) (Young J, 2015) and predict mortality, others estimate the risk of specific complications (Lee index, respiratory risk scale, etc.) .\n\nScales including intraoperative and postoperative parameters such as the POSSUM series of scales (Whiteley MS, 1996) are also being developed. The analysis shows that in routine clinical practice, these scales are not used very often, due to their limitations: subjectivity, technical complexity and often - low specificity and sensitivity.\n\nConcomitant diseases are the strongest predictors of postoperative adverse events and annual mortality. Monk et al. (2005) demonstrated that Charlson's comorbidity score of 3 or more significantly increased the risk of death. In addition, in most clinical studies, the ASAclassification of physical status as a kind of comprehensive assessment of patient comorbidity has repeatedly proved to be one of the strongest independent predictors of postoperative morbidity and mortality, despite the fact that this assessment is based on subjective perception (Watt J., 2018).\n\nThe main concomitant diseases that are independent predictors of perioperative complications are diseases of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems (Van Diepen S, 2011). Increasing age, anemia, obesity, diabetes - these conditions also increase the risk of an adverse outcome. Diseases of the Central nervous system and neuromuscular diseases significantly disrupt the function of respiration, can change the level of the Autonomous regulation of the cardiovascular system, lead to significant cognitive disorders and nutritional deficiency, which also increases the risk of perioperative complications (Hachenberg T, 2014).\n\nOn the other hand, large-scale observational studies conducted in recent years in a number of countries have not identified comorbidities as independent predictors of postoperative complications (Malik, 2018).\n\nThus, data on the risk effects of comorbidities are contradictory and may be influenced by differences in the frequency and structure of these diseases in heterogeneous populations, as well as in different treatment strategies for cardiovascular, respiratory and other diseases. The identification of these risk factors is necessary to understand the pathophysiology of complications and identify potential ways to reduce anesthetic risk, such as the correction of concomitant disease.\n\nThe degree of risk of surgery, of course, depends not only on the presence of comorbidities and their combinations, but also on the severity of surgical injury (Pearse RM, 2012, ISOS group, 2017), as well as the level of exposure to drugs for anesthesia and anesthetic techniques (Malik OS, 2018), therefore, the allocation of risk groups without these factors is also not appropriate.\n\nObjective: to assess the frequency and structure of comorbidities in patients undergoing surgery on the abdominal organs and to stratify the risk of postoperative complications by determining independent\n\nEvaluated parameters in study:\n\n1\\. Age, gender; 2. Class of physical status by ASA; 3. The presence and type of concomitant disease; 3.1 CHD; 3.2 CHF; 3.3 Heart rhythm disorders; 3.4 COPD; 3.5 Bronchial Asthma; 3.6 CKD; 3.7 CNS diseases; 3.7.1 Stroke; 3.7.2 Epilepsy; 3.7.3 Parkinson's Disease; 3.7.4 Alzheimer's Disease; 3.8 Neuromuscular diseases; 3.9 Diabetes; 3.10 Anemia; 4 Treatment received by the patient; 4.1 β-blockers; 4.2 ACE Inhibitors; 4.3 Aldosterone antagonists; 4.4 Statins; 4.5 Anticoagulants; 4.6 Diuretics; 4.7 Bronchodilators; 4.8 Corticosteriods; 4.9 Insulin; 4.10 Anticonvulsants; 5. The type and severity of surgery ; 5.1 Open surgery on the organs of the upper abdomen; 5.2 Coloproctological operations; 5.3 Gynecological surgery; 5.4 Urological surgery; 5.5 Operations on vessels of the abdominal cavity; 5.6 Abdominal wall surgery; 5.7 Laparoscopic surgery; 6 Type of anesthesia; 6.1 Spinal; 6.2 Epidural; 6.3 Combined spinal-epidural; 6.4 Intravenous; 6.5 Combined; 6.6 General+epidural; 7. Integral scales; 7.1 The cognitive function of the Montreal scale ; 7.2 Respiratory risk ; 7.3 Lee's Cardiovascular Risk Scale ; 7.4 NSQIP Cardiac risk scale ; 7.5 Hepatic insufficiency according to MELD; 7.6 CKD Stage by Level of GFR and Albuminuria; 7.7 COPD degree by GOLD.\n\nOrder of conduct\n\n1. The data is registered in the Excel electronic database in a uniform format for all centers (the form will be sent by the coordinator to all centers participating in the study prior to the inclusion of patients).\n2. All centers need to get approval by the local ethics committee before the start of the study. The study protocol will be registered in Clinicaltrial.gov.\n3. The study includes all patients operated on within one operational day at the discretion of the center and meeting the inclusion criteria with registration in the questionnaire of the day of the week.\n4. All patients could sign informed consent to participate in the study prior to inclusion in the study.\n5. Before surgery, data on the patient and all studied factors specified in the study protocol are entered into the database.\n6. All patients included in the study are monitored before discharge from the hospital with registration of the data specified in the protocol.\n\n6\\. Every last day of the working week, all completed cases are sent as a separate Excel file to the study coordinator by email to trembachnv@mail.ru 7. The originals of the questionnaires are stored in the centers for the entire study time and for 3 years after its completion.\n\n8\\. The summary database is formed by the study coordinator and provided to the centers after the end of the study.\n\nStatistical analysis The sample size was calculated taking into account the fact that at least 10 cases of postoperative complications per one factor included in the final regression model are required. Given the wide range of complication rates in previous studies (from 3% to 20%), we have chosen a lower bound for a more accurate assessment. To include 20 potential risk factors in the regression model, 200 cases of postoperative complications are required, which at a frequency of 3% is not less than 7000 people. Taking into account the risk of data loss, and taking into account as many potential risk factors as possible, the size of the required sample was increased to 12,000 people, which will also assess the contribution of comorbidities to certain groups of complications. For validation of predictive models will be recruited 4,000 additional. The inclusion of the patient in the main and validation group will be carried out randomly.\n\nThe character of distribution of studied parameters will be evaluated using the criterion Kolmogorov-Smirnov. The continuous data will be presented as the median and interquartile range for the nonparametric distribution and as the mean and standard deviation for the parametric distribution. Categorical variables will be presented as the number of patients and a percentage of the total number of patients.\n\nFor the initial assessment of the Association of the factor with postoperative complications, a single-factor analysis using the χ2 criterion and the Mann-Whitney test will be carried out. All variables with a reliable relationship identified in the univariate analysis (p less than 0.05) will be included in logistic regression if there is no collinearity between them (correlation coefficient less than 0.25). The logistic regression model will be constructed using a step-by-step reverse inclusion procedure in which the presence of a complication will be a dependent variable. Potential predictors will be removed if this exception does not cause a significant change in the log likelihood ratio. The criterion for excluding the factor will be set at the significance level of 0.05. Adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals will also be calculated.\n\nThe resulting predictive model will be evaluated in the validation group using ROC analysis and the Hosmer-Lemeshov test."

          "detailedDescription": "The purpose of this research project is to study risks and outcomes in patients who underwent cardiac surgery. We aim to establish a fundament for the conduct of nationwide population-based studies by linking patient-level data from the Swedish Heart Surgery Register (SWEDEHEART), the National Patient Register, the Cause of Death Register, the National Diabetes Register, the Swedish Renal Registry, the Prescribed Drug Register, and the 2nd version of the Swedish-Danish Scandinavian Donations and Transfusions database. Cross-linking patient-level data is possible through the Personal Identity Number assigned to every individual who has resided in Sweden on a permanent basis. The Swedish Personal Identity Number is the unique identifier in all national registers.\n\nSpecifically, we aim:\n\n1. To assess the importance of chronic kidney disease for prognosis after CABG.\n2. To assess the consequences of acute kidney injury following CABG.\n3. To analyze the prognosis in patients with depression prior to CABG.\n4. To study risks and benefits of blood transfusions in cardiac surgery.\n5. To study the risks associated with diabetes mellitus in cardiac surgery with special reference to type of diabetes (type 1 and type 2) and glycaemic control and duration of disease.\n6. To investigate the long-term impact of different surgical strategies (e.g. use of multiple arterial grafts or non-use of cardio-pulmonary bypass) during CABG.\n7. To analyze prognosis in relevant sub-populations undergoing CABG (e.g. patients 50 years or younger, possible differences between men and women, and patients with heart failure with preserved vs. reduced ejection fraction).\n8. To investigate survival and morbidity in patients between 50 and 69 years undergoing aortic valve replacement with particular reference to prosthesis type (mechanical vs. biological).\n9. To analyze the association between socioeconomic factors and prognosis in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.\n10. To investigate factors related to durability of bioprosthetic aortic heart valves."

          "briefSummary": "The CONNECT: \"Developing a learning COmmunity to increase eNgagemeNt and Enrollment in cardiovascular Clinical Trials\" is comprehensive, participant-centered learning platform designed to increase diversity in cardiovascular disease research among women and Black and Latino adults. CONNECT will deploy electronic health record (EHR)-informed and community-engaged recruitment approaches to identify and recruit adults with cardiovascular disease or a cardiovascular disease risk factor to join CONNECT. Participants who join CONNECT will receive tailored educational information on cardiovascular health and research participation via text message. Participants will also have the opportunity to be connected to ongoing cardiovascular research studies based on basic demographic information and areas of interest. The educational information will be sent to participants for 12 months. The CONNECT platform will be used to evaluate recruitment methods. The investigators hypothesize the proportion of women and Black and Latin adults enrolled in trials that partner with CONNECT will be higher following the use of CONNECT for recruitment. Investigators also hypothesize that participating in CONNECT will increase participants' clinical trial awareness, trust, and willingness to participate in clinical trials.",
          "detailedDescription": "The CONNECT project, titled \"Developing a learning COmmunity to increase eNgagemeNt and Enrollment in cardiovascular Clinical Trials,\" seeks to establish an comprehensive learning platform aimed at improving diversity and representation in cardiovascular research. It encompasses three primary objectives:\n\n1. Identifying best practices for research recruitment and engagement among women and Black and Latino adults.\n2. Increasing participation in cardiovascular health research among women and Black and Latino adults.\n3. Improving trust in and awareness of cardiovascular research among women and Black and Latino adults.\n\nA multi-method recruitment campaign will be implemented, utilizing both electronic health record (EHR)-informed and community-based strategies. A sub-study will be conducted to understand the effectiveness of EHR-informed recruitment. This sub-study will randomly assign a subsample of individuals identified in the EHR to one of three outreach modalities: patient portal message, email, and postal mail. Enrollment yield will be calculated for each recruitment method, with logistic regression modeling estimating the odds of enrollment by recruitment outreach type, both overall and among different demographic groups.\n\nUpon enrollment, participants will specify preferences for receiving text messages regarding heart health, research education, and study opportunities. Messaging will focus on cardiovascular health prevention, management strategies, and research processes, with the aim of fostering trust in research within the community. Pre-post surveys will be distributed to assess changes in clinical trial awareness, trust in medical research, and willingness to participate in trials at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months post-enrollment. Interaction terms will be used to evaluate differences in outcomes by race, ethnicity, and sex.\n\nThe process for matching participants to research within the CONNECT project involves individual researchers submitting requests to the CONNECT study team for access to the learning community as a recruitment resource, followed by approval Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval. Upon access, researchers can retrieve, and view records of participants matched to respective studies, ensuring access only to data pertinent to the research objectives. Verification of IRB approval is mandated, and the CONNECT study team will request documentation from the individual research team's IRB to confirm compliance before granting access. Researchers using CONNECT must document eligibility and enrollment data for each CONNECT participant matched to the participants study. Proportions of participants matched to and enrolled in ongoing research studies will be tabulated and compared across demographic groups."

Abnormalities in specific components (basal vs. static vs. dynamic) of beta-cell function in CFRDF508del+ETI and in CFRD-ETI individuals.\n2. Effects of ETI on components of beta cell function.\n3.

          "briefSummary": "The overall objective of this in-lab randomized controlled trial is to test the efficacy of multi-day interruptions in sedentary behavior vs. single bouts of sustained exercise on metabolic, cognitive, affective, and cardiac autonomic nervous system responses in children with overweight and obesity who are at risk for type 2 diabetes. The use of continuous glucose monitoring will provide insight into the daily and cumulative metabolic effects of each condition that have thus far not been studied. In-lab studies demonstrating sustained efficacy of this approach in ameliorating negative effects of sedentary behaviors in children are necessary for the optimization of field-based interventions. Given the lack of success of interventions to prevent obesity-related diseases and increasing rates of type 2 diabetes in children and its related healthcare costs, this study addresses a critical public health need by testing of novel intervention strategies to reduce obesity-related diseases in children with overweight and obesity.",
          "detailedDescription": "Rationale: Sedentary behavior (SB) contributes to increased risk for obesity and metabolic disease, cognitive deficits, affect disorders, and cardiovascular disease over the lifespan. These are critical outcomes because children with these risk factors are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). SB increases T2DM risk by promoting hyperglycemia and greater postprandial glycemic variability as well as via cognitive detriments and depressive symptoms that lead to poor energy balance behaviors, obesity, and worsening insulin resistance. Additionally, prolonged SB may contribute to dominance of the sympathetic nervous system and lead to poor cardiovascular disease outcomes. Physical activity can reduce these risk factors, however less than half of US youth meet guideline recommendations, and physical activity continues to decline throughout adolescence. Thus, there is a critical need to test alternative intervention approaches to sustained bouts of exercise for the prevention of T2DM in children. The investigators were the first to show that interrupting SB with short, 3-minute, bouts of moderate exercise improved glucose tolerance and negative mood in a single 3-hour session. However, it is unknown whether these short-term improvements translate to sustained multi-day benefits to metabolic, cognitive, mood, and cardiac autonomic nervous system outcomes.\n\nIntervention: This phase II randomized controlled trial (RCT) will compare the effects of SB interruptions vs. sustained bouts of exercise to prolonged sitting in 8-11-year-old children with overweight/obesity. Participants (N=150 (50 per group)) will be recruited from the community. The participants will wear continuous glucose monitors for one week and complete pre- and post- experiment 3-hour oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT). Children will be randomized to 7 consecutive days of one of the following 3-hour experimental conditions: a) continuous sitting (SIT); b) sitting interrupted by 3-minute bouts of moderate-intensity walking every 30 minutes (SIT+WALK); or c) a single 18-minute bout of moderate-intensity walking followed by continuous sitting (EX).\n\nObjectives/Purpose: The overall goal of this study is to test the efficacy of multi-day effects of interrupting SB as a T2DM prevention strategy in youth with overweight/obesity. This proposal will address the following aims: (1) determine the multi-day efficacy of interrupting sitting on glucose homeostasis measured by continuous glucose monitor and oral glucose tolerance tests; (2) determine the multi-day efficacy of interrupting sitting on cognitive function improvements; (3) determine the multi-day efficacy of interrupting sitting on affect and anxiety improvements; and (4) determine the multi-day efficacy of interrupting sitting on cardiac autonomic nervous system improvements measured by heart rate variability.\n\nStudy Population: The study population will consist of children with overweight/obesity recruited from the greater Los Angeles area. Children will be screened for eligibility (no evidence of type 2 diabetes, have overweight/obesity, be in good health, and be in early pubertal stages).\n\nStudy Methodology: This study is a phase II RCT with 3 study arms. Participants (N=150) will complete one screening visit to determine eligibility, complete a fitness test, and body composition analysis via dual x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). All participants will complete two 3-hour in-lab oral glucose tolerance tests (spaced 6 days apart). Participants will wear an activity monitor on the right thigh and an electrocardiogram (ECG) monitor on the chest 7 days to determine baseline activity levels and heart rate variability, respectively. Then, participants will complete 7 consecutive in-lab sessions (SIT, SIT+WALK, or EX), with a 3-hour OGTT on Days 1 and 7. Participants will wear activity monitors, continuous glucose monitors, and ECG monitors during these 7 days of experimental sessions. Questionnaires will assess dietary intake, affect, anxiety, and mood, and the NIH Toolbox will assess executive cognitive function.\n\nStudy Arms: Participants will be randomized to 7 consecutive days of one of the following 3-hour experimental conditions in the lab: a) continuous sitting (SIT); b) sitting interrupted by 3-minute bouts of moderate-intensity walking every 30 minutes (SIT+WALK); or c) a single 18-minute bout of moderate-intensity walking followed by continuous sitting (EX).\n\nEndpoints/Outcomes: The primary endpoints are: insulin, C-peptide, and glucose area under the curve (AUC) in the in-lab experiments, and glucose AUC from the continuous glucose monitor. Secondary endpoints are positive and negative affect, anxiety, executive cognitive function, and heart rate variability metrics.\n\nFollow-up: Study duration is estimated as 14 days minimum and 30 days maximum, to allow for a 7-21 day period between the screening and experimental visits.\n\nStatistical Analyses: The populations for analyses include the full analytical dataset which consists of all randomized study participants; the investigators will employ per protocol and intent to treat analyses."

          "briefSummary": "Surgery is one of the management options for type 2 diabetes in patients with moderate obesity. This is a recent option because it has been part of the recommendations since October 2022.\n\nThe possible surgical techniques are the same as those for bariatric surgery:\n\n* Sleeve,\n* Bypass,\n* Gastric band, but the main goal is not weight loss, it is remission of type 2 diabetes. It is called metabolic surgery.\n\nThe ring technique (gastroplasty) is practiced less and less in France because it is less effective in weight loss and is responsible for major discomfort.\n\nCurrently, metabolic surgery is one of the recommendations but no study has compared the effectiveness of the techniques with each other. One or other of the techniques can be chosen according to the preferences of the surgeon, the patient, the center, etc. but this choice is not made objectively, in the absence of comparative data.\n\nThis study would like to follow up on patients for whom metabolic surgery has been proposed by the doctor,.\n\nIf the surgery is accepted, this study would like to improve knowledge of the effectiveness of the different techniques, and thus demonstrate which metabolic surgery technique is preferred in terms of effectiveness and safety."

          "briefSummary": "This study aims to evaluate the clinical utility and acceptability to patients and practitioners of running diabetes classification algorithms on primary care data to help improve diagnosis of diabetes subtypes in adults diagnosed with diabetes under the age of 50. The outputs from this research will help provide initial data on how best to use these algorithms in primary care and the optimal design of a decision support tool that could be taken forward to a full trial.",
          "detailedDescription": "Part 1:\n\nUsing a successful approach from previous research, and experience from existing online diabetes classification calculators, we will test the feasibility of developing a decision support tool that would run the algorithms in these calculators on electronic healthcare record data at participating GP sites. We will work with a company that will develop a decision support tool that will search and extract relevant healthcare data in GP systems, run our algorithms on these data, and produce a display, highlighting patient records where there is a potential misclassification of diabetes and/or records where there are potential data quality issues (e.g. mis-coding or missing information). The decision support tool will only run on extracted data (rather than being embedded in the GP system).\n\nParticipating GP sites will be offered an introductory education session on classification of diabetes subtypes and identification of MODY (Maturity Onset Diabetes of the Young) and training on running and interpreting the decision tool.\n\nOn receipt of the outputs from the decision support tool, practice staff will be advised to review the records of potentially misclassified patients to explore any mis-codings and to consider further testing/referrals as relevant and in line with the standard clinical care pathway for diabetes.\n\nAt the end of the study, the data extraction/decision support tool may be re-run to determine whether there have been changes and whether additional testing (eg C-peptide or islet autoantibody) or referral to a diabetes specialist team has been carried out.\n\nPart 2:\n\nTo assess the acceptability of the diabetes classification tools to potential users, and to consider how best to implement them in clinical practice long term for maximum benefit, we will explore the views and experiences of general practice teams and people with diabetes on the use of the diabetes classification tools.\n\nA sample of clinical and admin staff at participating GP sites, and diabetes patients flagged by the tool as misclassified, will be invited to take part in a semi-structured interview about their views \\& experience."

The study will collect data using standardized instruments, including the EQ-5D Health-Related Quality of Life Questionnaire, the PHQ-9 Depression Scale, and the Shalom Scale of Psychological Well-Being, along with demographic and clinical variables such as age, sex, education, body mass index, HbA1c, disease duration, and psychosocial support indicators. Descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation analyses, ANOVA, and multiple linear regression modeling will be performed to identify factors associated with psychological well-being. The findings are expected to provide evidence-based insights to inform tailored interventions and improve the mental health and quality of life of patients with type 2 diabetes.",
          "detailedDescription": "This is a prospective, cross-sectional observational study designed to examine the relationships among psychological well-being, depression, and quality of life in adult patients with type 2 diabetes attending the outpatient metabolic clinic at National Taiwan University Hospital. The study seeks to identify demographic, clinical, and psychosocial factors associated with psychological well-being in this population.\n\nEligible participants will be ≥18 years old, diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, able to complete self-administered Chinese questionnaires, and willing to provide written informed consent. Patients with major psychiatric disorders, moderate to severe cognitive impairment, acute diabetic complications, or significant communication barriers will be excluded.\n\nData collection will include demographic variables (e.g., age, sex, education, marital status, religious belief, economic status, family support, sleep quality, exercise habits) and clinical indicators (e.g., diabetes duration, BMI, HbA1c, diabetic complications, estimated glomerular filtration rate). Three standardized instruments will be administered:\n\nEQ-5D-5L to measure health-related quality of life\n\nPHQ-9 to assess depressive symptoms\n\nShalom Scale to evaluate psychological well-being\n\nThe planned sample size is 350 participants. Recruitment will be conducted by the research team during clinic hours. Written informed consent will be obtained before any data collection.\n\nStatistical analyses will include descriptive statistics to summarize participant characteristics and scale scores, Pearson correlation analyses to examine associations between variables, one-way ANOVA to compare psychological well-being across subgroups, and multiple linear regression modeling to identify predictors of psychological well-being.\n\nThe study period is from September 2025 to December 2026. This research is investigator-initiated and self-funded. The results will provide an evidence-based foundation for designing tailored clinical and psychosocial interventions to improve mental health and quality of life in patients with type 2 diabetes."

          "briefSummary": "Diabetes mellitus is recognized as a metabolic disease that causes global economic and health burdens with an estimated number of patients 135 million in 1995 to 300 million in 2025. Moreover, the Asia-Pacific region is considered to be on the verge of an emerging diabetes epidemic. Diabetes is associated with numerous comorbidities due to a wide range of complications, such as retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, and cardiovascular disease, which could lead to premature mortality. Management of diabetes under standard treatment protocol improves quality of life and prevents complications and premature mortality. Pathogenesis of these detrimental complications caused by diabetes is not yet discovered and it is important to reveal epidemiology and mechanisms of diabetes and its complications in order to successfully manage and control diabetes. According to the Committee of the Korean Diabetes Association on the Epidemiology of Diabetes Mellitus, only about one third of patients with diabetes was found to reach target glycemic control (\\<7% of HbA1c) and 30.3%, 38.3% and 44.6% of patients found to have microalbuminuria, retinopathy and nephropathy, respectively in tertiary hospitals of Korea in 2006. Also, prevalence of coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease and peripheral artery disease was 8.7%, 6.75 and 3.0%, respectively in tertiary hospitals. Due to inadequate achievement of glycemic control and improper prevention tactics to prevent diabetic complication for patients in tertiary hospitals in Korea, it is pivotal to determine and analyze the current status of patients with diabetes and prediabetes for efficient management of diabetes/prediabetes and its complications. Annual visits of newly diagnosed diabetes or prediabetes to Endocrinology department of Severance hospital in Korea are increasing, about 5,000 patients per year since 2017. However, there is no current systemic clinical registry involving patients with diabetes or prediabetes in Severance hospital. Therefore, in this prospective cohort study, we will establish registry for patients with diabetes or prediabetes who would perform standard blood/urine tests and follow treatment protocols in Endocrinology department of Severance hospital."

          "briefSummary": "Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is one of the most common complications of diabetes, and its association with cognitive dysfunctions is becoming an increasingly frequent research interest. Non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) encompasses early changes at the microvascular level, which can be detected quantitatively and qualitatively through optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) well before the first symptoms of this disease appear. Cognitive dysfunction is often unrecognized in the early stages of diabetes. This research will focus on examining the association between OCTA parameters and cognitive functions in patients with NPDR. The aim of this study is to investigate the correlation between OCTA parameters and cognitive functions in patients with NPDR using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scale to assess cognitive abilities and to establish a connection between OCTA biomarkers and changes in cognitive function. Patients with type 2 diabetes will be included in the study. Patients with proliferations and diabetic macular edema affecting the center and reducing visual acuity will be excluded to minimize error in cognitive function assessment caused by vision impairment. OCTA will be used to analyze microvascular changes in the retina, including capillary density and areas of the avascular zone. At the same time, the MoCA scale will be used to assess cognitive function, focusing on aspects of memory, attention, executive function, and orientation. Data analysis will investigate correlations between OCTA parameters, the presence of diabetic retinopathy-related changes in the eye fundus, as well as the stage of retinopathy and MoCA scale scores, taking into account factors such as diabetes duration, previous diabetes treatment, lipid status, anthropometric parameters, and glycemic control. The results of this research are expected to provide better insight into the early diagnosis of cognitive dysfunctions in patients with diabetes, thereby contributing to the development of targeted interventions.",
          "detailedDescription": "OCTA represents a potential alternative for early detection of vascular abnormalities. OCTA algorithms generate an image, most commonly sized 3x3 mm or 6x6 mm, which is conventionally segmented into four zones: superficial retinal plexus, deep retinal plexus, outer retina, and choriocapillaris. OCTA enables monitoring of retinal vascular changes over time and allows early detection of microcirculatory abnormalities.\n\nCognition is the process by which the human brain receives information from the external environment, processes it, and transforms it into internal psychological activities for acquiring or applying knowledge. It includes memory, language, visuospatial skills, executive function, calculation, comprehension, and judgment. Various cognitive function tests have been developed through years of research. The most commonly used screening test for general cognitive function is the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), while a more recent and sensitive tool is the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). The MoCA test includes assessments of executive functions, high-level language abilities, and complex visuospatial tasks, making it suitable for detecting even mild cognitive dysfunction. Although these tests can assess a patient's cognitive level, they cannot confirm the presence of cerebral microvascular disease.\n\nNumerous studies suggest a link between diabetes mellitus and cognitive impairment. While cognitive decline is not specific to diabetes, it is now recognized as a complication of the disease. In studies involving older populations, patients with diabetes demonstrated a higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia. Since diabetes affects the entire vascular system, it is assumed that changes in the retinal microvasculature may reflect the general vascular condition of the body, including changes in the brain. Studies have shown that patients with advanced stages of DR often exhibit reduced cerebral blood flow, further contributing to cognitive decline.\n\nResearch also suggests that early interventional treatments, such as improved glycemic control and therapies aimed at enhancing vascular function, could reduce the risk of cognitive deterioration. There is growing evidence that changes in the retinal microvascular structure may reflect similar alterations in cerebral vascular structures, given that the retina and brain share common embryological and anatomical characteristics.\n\nThis study differs from previous ones as it focuses exclusively on the early stages of NPDR, including patients with diabetes who show no detectable changes on fundoscopy. This minimizes the risk of errors on the MoCA scale, since patients with reduced visual acuity due to macular edema or proliferative changes may score falsely low, leading to inaccurate assessments of their cognitive function.\n\nMoreover, the MoCA scale used in this study is more comprehensive, providing a detailed evaluation of cognitive function, unlike previous studies which often used shorter tests or focused on isolated cognitive domains. The results of this research will define the specific OCTA parameters associated with cognitive function, making them potential biomarkers for detecting both ophthalmological and neurological disorders in diabetic patients.\n\nAim\n\n1. To examine whether changes detected in the retinal layers and retinal vasculature using OCTA correlate with cognitive impairment in patients with type 2 diabetes.\n2. To investigate whether the decline in cognitive function is more pronounced in patients with more advanced stages of the disease.\n3. To identify retinal microvascular biomarkers using OCTA that could be used for the early detection of cognitive impairment and the severity of diabetic retinopathy in affected patients.\n\nWorking hypothesis:\n\nPatients with diabetic retinopathy exhibit reduced cognitive function compared to patients without diabetic retinopathy. An increase in macular ischemia leads to a decline in cognitive function.\n\nA prospective cross-sectional clinical study will be conducted at the General Hospital \"Prim. Dr. Abdulah Nakaš\" and the private ophthalmology clinic \"Dr. Sefić\" in Sarajevo, from January 1, 2025, to January 1, 2026, or until the target number of participants is reached. Approval from the Ethics Committee for conducting the study was obtained on January 9, 2025 (Reference No. 26-213-114/25). A total of 210 participants will be included in the study, who will be divided into three groups of 70 based on clinical, laboratory, and ophthalmological indicators:\n\n* Group A: Patients with type 2 diabetes without diabetic retinopathy (DR) changes,\n* Group B: Patients with type 2 diabetes with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR),\n* Group C: Healthy individuals (control group). Basic anamnesis data will be collected for all participants using a specially designed form. The form will include basic demographic data (name and surname, age, gender), disease duration, presence of comorbidities, current treatment methods, and information on smoking and alcohol consumption. Laboratory parameters will be used for each participant, not older than one month, including: plasma glucose concentration (FPG), HbA1c, lipid profile, renal function parameters (urea and creatinine), and systolic and diastolic blood pressure.\n\nEach participant will be fully informed about the study and allowed to ask additional questions. Participation will be confirmed by signing an informed consent form, which clearly outlines the study details. The study will adhere to the principles of the Nuremberg Code, the latest revision of the Declaration of Helsinki, the Law on Health Protection (\"Official Gazette of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina,\" No. 46/10), and the Law on the Rights, Duties, and Responsibilities of Patients (\"Official Gazette of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina,\" No. 40/10). Data will be collected in accordance with ethical principles, ensuring participant privacy and data confidentiality. The data obtained will be used solely for this research. Ethical approval was requested from the Ethics Committee of the General Hospital \"Prim. Dr. Abdulah Nakaš\" in Sarajevo.\n\nParticipants will first complete the MoCA test, version 7.1, translated into Croatian. The MoCA test is a widely used screening tool for detecting mild cognitive impairment and early signs of dementia. It can help identify individuals at risk for Alzheimer's disease and screen for conditions such as Parkinson's disease or the effects of brain tumors. MoCA is a simple tool that quickly assesses cognitive impairment, including the ability to understand, reason, and remember.\n\nThe test consists of 14 different tasks with a maximum total score of 30 points. During the test, patients will be given instructions for each task, with an explanation of the test duration and purpose. The test lasts 10-12 minutes and assesses seven areas of cognitive function:\n\n1. Visuospatial/executive function - the participant connects alternating numbers and letters, draws a three-dimensional cube, and draws a clock showing 4:05 (3 tasks, 5 points total);\n2. Naming - the participant is shown images of three animals and asked to name them (1 point each, 3 points total);\n3. Attention - includes four tasks: repeating numbers forward and backward, identifying the letter \"A\" in a sequence, and subtracting 7 from 100 backward (6 points total);\n4. Language - repeating two sentences exactly as spoken and listing as many words as possible beginning with the letter T within one minute (3 points total);\n5. Abstract thinking - identifying common features between two concepts, after a similar example is provided (2 points total);\n6. Delayed recall - remembering and recalling five words that were given at the beginning of the test after five minutes (5 points total);\n7. Orientation - answering questions about the date, month, year, day of the week, city, and place where the person is located (6 points total).\n\nThe total possible score is 30 points. If a person has 12 or fewer years of formal education, 1 point is added to the total score. After completing the test, the total score and individual section scores will be calculated for each participant.\n\nTest results are interpreted as follows:\n\n1. Normal cognition: 26-30 points\n2. Mild cognitive impairment: 18-25 points\n3. Moderate impairment: 10-17 points\n4. Severe impairment: \\<10 points\n\nThe ophthalmological examination will include:\n\n1. Determination of best corrected visual acuity,\n2. Measurement of intraocular pressure using Goldmann applanation tonometry,\n3. Slit-lamp examination of the anterior segment,\n4. Slit-lamp examination of the posterior segment with detailed notation of microaneurysms, dot and blot hemorrhages, cotton wool spots, and hard exudates,\n5. OCTA (Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography) with qualitative and quantitative biomarker analysis.\n\nOCTA is a fast, non-invasive, and contactless imaging technique that enables detailed visualization of the retinal microvasculature by tracking erythrocyte movement within blood vessels in real time. It provides layer-by-layer analysis of the retina and choroid without the need for intravenous contrast, significantly reducing patient risk and improving accessibility. Increasing evidence suggests that neurodegenerative and vascular changes precede clinically visible signs of disease, making OCTA a valuable diagnostic tool for early detection of diabetic retinopathy before it can be confirmed through standard fundus examination. The OCTA device used will be the RTVue XR Avanti (Optovue, Inc., Fremont, California, USA).\n\nThe following quantitative OCTA biomarkers will be considered:\n\n1. Size and perimeter of the foveal avascular zone (FAZ) - FAZ is the central avascular area of the macula, and its size increases with DR progression, indicating retinal ischemia. FAZ perimeter measures the length of the avascular zone border; a larger perimeter is associated with worsening ischemia and DR progression.\n2. Vessel density - refers to the percentage of retinal area filled with vessels; it decreases as DR progresses, indicating microvascular network loss.\n3. Perfusion density - indicates the volume of blood circulating through retinal capillaries; a decrease may signal early vascular abnormalities in diabetes.\n4. Number of parafoveal capillary dropouts - represents areas of capillary loss or ischemia in the parafoveal region; an increased number indicates advancing microangiopathy.\n5. Perifoveal area (PeriFAZ) - the vascular network surrounding the FAZ; reduced perfusion density in this area suggests early ischemic damage in diabetic retinopathy.\n6. Fractal dimension (FD) - a mathematical parameter describing the complexity of the retinal vascular network; reduced FD values are associated with capillary structure loss in DR.\n\nThe expected scientific contribution of this research is the identification of an early correlation between retinal microvascular changes and cognitive decline in patients with type 2 diabetes. It is anticipated that these changes will be more pronounced in eyes showing signs of non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy, especially in its advanced stages. Such findings could enable timely ophthalmologic and neurologic interventions, thereby improving the quality of life for individuals with diabetes.\n\nOne of the key objectives of the study is to confirm the hypothesis that OCTA can serve as a non-invasive, quantitative biomarker for the early detection of cerebral vascular changes, reflected through microvascular alterations in the retina. In this way, OCTA could be positioned as a valuable tool for early identification of cognitive changes-potentially even before the appearance of classical neurological symptoms or findings on radiological imaging.\n\nThis research opens a new perspective in understanding the connection between ocular and cerebral vascular health and lays the foundation for future care models for diabetic patients, based on a multidisciplinary approach and early detection of the risk for cognitive decline."

          "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to learn if using amnion-chorion allografts or biomimetic scaffolds improves healing of chronic, non-healing foot ulcers in diabetic patients.\n\nThe main question that this study aims to answer is:\n\nDoes the use of amnion-chorion allografts or biomimetic scaffolds, when used in conjunction with standard of care wound management techniques, result in a higher percentage of target ulcers achieving complete closure (i.e. healing) as compared to ulcers being treated with standard of care alone after 12 weeks of treatment.\n\nOne ulcer on each participant's foot will receive weekly or biweekly applications of 1) amnion-chorion allografts or biomimetic scaffolds and standard of care wound management or 2) standard of care wound management alone. Pictures of the ulcer and measurements of its size will be measured every week to track its healing progress over a total treatment period of 12 weeks. Additionally, the participants will be asked to fill out a questionnaire about the wound impacts their life and their quality of life.",
          "detailedDescription": "Patients with diabetes often develop ulcers on their lower extremities. While some ulcers can be managed using standard of care wound management techniques including debridement, moist dressings, infection control and off-loading, many develop into chronic, non-healing wounds. Chronic non-healing wounds can lead to higher risk of infection, amputation and decreased quality of life.\n\nAdvanced wound therapies aim to promote rapid and complete healing of chronic wounds. Examples of an advanced wound therapies include perinatal tissue allografts (composed of amnion-chorion tissue) as well as scaffolds that contain and / or mimic the structure and function of the natural extracellular matrix of tissue. Human amniotic / chorionic membranes have been confirmed by the United States Food \\& Drug Administration's (US FDA) Tissue Reference Group to meet the criteria for regulation solely under Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act as defined in Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations - Part 1271 for the management of diabetic foot ulcers. Additionally, several biomimetic scaffolds have been cleared for the management of a variety of wounds (including DFU's) by the US FDA.\n\nThe focus of this clinical trial is to determine the clinical utility of treating diabetic foot ulcers with weekly or biweekly applications of perinatal tissue allografts or biomimetic scaffolds in addition to standard of care wound management techniques compared to applying standard of care wound management only.\n\nIt is hypothesized that the addition of perinatal tissue allografts or biomimetic scaffolds to standard of care treatment will result in a higher percentage of ulcers achieving complete closure (i.e. healing) compared to ulcer being treated with standard of care alone after 12 weeks of treatment.\n\nTo test this hypothesis the study will consist of patients who will undergo standard of care for 4-weeks prior to entering a 12-week treatment phase. During the 4-week standard of care phase, patients meeting inclusion criteria (including confirmation that ulcer does not reduce in area by more than 40%) will be randomized into the treatment groups. During the 12-week treatment phase, index wounds will be treated weekly with either allograft or scaffold and standard of care or standard of care alone.\n\nEvaluation of data (outcome measures) associated with the trial will include intent to treat and per protocol analyses which will be performed by at least one blinded statistician and investigator."

However, it is still unknown if this rise in blood sugar can be controlled using medications.\n\nThis study will examine the effects of three different diabetes treatments to determine if they improve night time blood sugars. Participants will be randomly assigned for 8 weeks to one of the following three groups:\n\nGROUP 1: Insulin. Participants will be instructed on self-injecting insulin glargine once-daily in the morning. The dose will be increased by the study team to avoid episodes of low blood sugar and to maintain fasting blood sugar concentrations between 70 to 180 mg/dl.\n\nGROUP 2: Metformin. Participants will start the drug (500 mg twice daily) with meals. After 72 hours and in the absence of side effects, they will increase the dose to 500 mg with breakfast and 1,000 mg with supper. After a further 72 hours and in the absence of side effects, they will increase the dose to 1,000 mg twice daily with meals and continue until the end of the trial. The dose will be adjusted by the study team to maintain fasting blood sugar concentrations between 70 to 180 mg/dl.\n\nGROUP 3: Dorzagliatin. This medication dose will be 75 mg twice daily. The investigators anticipate fasting glucose concentrations will be between 70 to 180 mg/dl since the dose of this medication cannot be titrated."
