          "briefSummary": "The aim of the Check@Home consortium is to set up a roadmap and infrastructure for a program to early detect atrial fibrillation and chronic kidney disease in the general population.\n\nThis will be a population-based screening with a phased implementation and an iterative design in four regions in the Netherlands (Breda, Utrecht, Arnhem, Eindhoven). In total, a random sample of 160,000 people (aged 50-75 years) will be invited to participate in the study and another random sample of 160,000 people with the same characteristics will be included in the control group in which no screening will be offered.\n\nThe overall screening program will consist of three phases: a home-based testing phase, diagnostic screening phase, and a treatment phase:\n\n* Phase 1: Subjects will be invited for a home-based screening that includes home-based testing; urine collection for detection of elevated albuminuria, and a heart rhythm measurement using a smartphone app for detection of atrial fibrillation.\n* Phase 2: Depending on the results on these home-based tests, subjects will be invited for further screening in a diagnostic screening facility. During this visit, physical data will be collected (height, weight, waist circumference, blood pressure, heart rhythm), blood will be drawn, and urine will be collected for the assessment of parameters that are indicative of a cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, type 2 diabetes or their risk factors. Participants will receive a questionnaire that include questions on demographics, educational level, disease history, medication use, health literacy, and quality of life.\n* Phase 3: Based on the results of the diagnostic screening, participants may be referred to their general practitioner for appropriate treatment (lifestyle advice/medication) according to the prevailing guidelines.\n\nThe primary study outcomes are:\n\nOverall effectiveness of population based screening on atrial fibrillation and chronic kidney disease in subjects aged 50-75 years, based on:\n\n* Participation rate of different screening strategies and phases;\n* Yield of the screening (number of subjects with (newly) diagnosed disease and risk factors);\n* Effectiveness of the atrial fibrillation screening, compared with standard care, based on the incidence of ischemic stroke);\n* Effectiveness of the albuminuria screening, compared with standard care, based on the incidence of kidney failure events and Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE).",
          "detailedDescription": "Background:\n\nCurrently, in the Netherlands there is no structured national approach for the early detection of cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, and type 2 diabetes in the general population, despite the social and economic impact of these disorders. Detecting these chronic conditions at an early stage could allow for adequate and early treatment to prevent the progression of these conditions and their complications, thereby reducing the societal and economic burden caused by these chronic diseases.\n\nObjective of the study:\n\nTo investigate whether population-based screening of subjects aged 50-75 years can contribute to early detection and treatment of atrial fibrillation and chronic kidney disease (defined by elevated albuminuria), and thereby can contribute to prevention of the morbidity and mortality related to these diseases. This will be done by evaluating the participation rate, yield, and (cost-)effectiveness of the screening compared with standard care. Furthermore, the project aims to evaluate options for broader screening, including the early detection of heart failure, coronary artery disease, and type 2 diabetes.\n\nStudy design:\n\nThis will be a population-based screening with a phased implementation and an iterative design in four regions in the Netherlands (Breda, Utrecht, Arnhem, Eindhoven).\n\nParticipants will be invited for a home-based screening (phase 1) that includes home-based testing; urine collection for detection of elevated albuminuria as indicator of chronic kidney disease, and a heart rhythm measurement using a smartphone app for detection of atrial fibrillation. Both home-based tests will be performed with CE-marked medical devices used according to their intended use. A subset of the population will also receive a short questionnaire. Depending on the results of the home-based tests, subjects might be invited for further screening in a diagnostic screening facility (phase 2). During this visit, physical data (height, weight, waist circumference, blood pressure, heart rhythm) will be collected, blood will be drawn, and urine will be collected for the assessment of parameters that are indicative of a cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, type 2 diabetes or their risk factors. Participants will receive a questionnaire that includes questions on demographics, educational level, disease history, medication use, health literacy, and quality of life. Based on the results of the diagnostic screening, participants may be referred to their general practitioner for appropriate treatment (lifestyle advice/medication) according to the prevailing guidelines. It is planned that in a future protocol amendment an alternative treatment trajectory will be added in which participants may receive further treatment in the diagnostic screening facility.\n\nStudy population:\n\nIn total, a random sample of 160,000 people (aged 50-75 years) living in one of the four selected regions in the Netherlands will be invited to participate in the study. Another random sample of 160,000 people (aged 50-75 years) living in one of the four selected regions in the Netherlands will be included in the control group in which no screening will be offered."

          "detailedDescription": "Older adults with type 2 diabetes experience an accelerated rate of sarcopenia, which is the deterioration in muscle mass, strength and physical performance. Periods of disuse caused by illness or hospitalization cause rapid loss of muscle mass and strength, which negatively impact physical function upon re-ambulation. The impact of type 2 diabetes on acute muscle atrophy and recovery from disuse is a critical issue that has not been investigated.\n\nThe overall objectives of this study are to employ highly innovative methods in muscle biopsy specimens in order to decipher the temporal sequence by which mitochondrial dysfunction and lipotoxicity in older adults with pre-diabetes and type 2 diabetes impact atrophy and recovery of muscle mass, strength and physical function following bed rest. Older adults with and without pre-diabetes/type 2 diabetes will complete 10 days of strict bed rest followed by 4 weeks of ambulatory recovery. During bed rest muscle biopsies will be collected to determine mitochondrial function and lipid profile. During the recovery period the recovery of muscle mass, strength and physical function will be determined."

          "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to determine whether the sequence of macronutrient consumption affects post-prandial glycaemia in women with gestational diabetes mellitus.\n\nThe main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* The difference in the magnitude of postprandial rise in blood glucose between the two test meals.\n* The difference in the magnitude of postprandial change in serum levels of gut hormones between the two test meals.\n* The difference in mean change in pre-post ingestion satiety scores between the two test meals.\n* The difference in 24 hour energy and macronutrient intake following the two test meals.\n\nParticipants will attend two study visits at the Centre for Public Health, with an interval of at least two days between the visits and complete the following, anthropometric measurements, demographic and appetite questionnaires, glucose measurements, two food diaries and fasting blood samples and the consumption of the study breakfast. Participants will be asked to eat either the protein/fat-based component of the meal (scrambled egg) before or after the carbohydrate-based component (wholemeal toast) on their first visit and on the other visit they will be asked to eat the meal in the reverse order. The order in which this occurs will be randomised and each participant will act as their own control. Researchers will compare the results from participants between the two test meals to see if the order of macronutrient consumption has any effect on post-prandial glycaemia, gut hormones, satiety scores and energy and macronutrient intake.",
          "detailedDescription": "Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is glucose intolerance with onset or first diagnosis during pregnancy, affecting around 1 in 10 pregnancies in the United Kingdom (UK). Women with GDM are 10 times more likely to develop type 2 DM and twice as likely to develop cardiovascular disease in later life than women without GDM. Dietary modification is recommended as first line management to optimise blood glucose control. However, this often fails, necessitating the use of medication such as metformin and insulin. There is a pressing need to find safe and effective dietary approaches to optimise glycaemic control in GDM which can be easily adhered to in order to improve longer-term outcomes. The impact of the sequence of macronutrients on glycaemic control is an emerging area of interest. Recent evidence suggests that the consumption of the fat/protein components of a meal prior to the carbohydrate components, reduces the peak by around 40% after food. This study aims to determine whether the order that macronutrients (i.e. protein, fat, carbohydrate) are eaten affects; blood sugar glucose levels in the blood after a meal, appetite, food intake and the release of hormones in the body, in women with GDM.\n\nPregnant women with GDM, aged 18-50 years old are eligible for the study. Women are not eligible if they have a history of type 1 or 2 diabetes, any clinically confirmed food allergies, taking medication for GDM, severe nausea or using anti-sickness medication.\n\nRecruitment will be via antenatal clinics in the South-Eastern Health and Social Care Trust (SEHSCT). Participants will attend the Centre for Public Health on two occasions (maximum 2 weeks between visits) and will involve the collection of demographic information, weight and height measurements, blood samples, glucose measurements, consumption of study breakfast, and completion of two 1-day food diaries.\n\nParticipants will be asked to eat either the protein/fat-based component of the meal (scrambled egg) before or after the carbohydrate-based component (wholemeal toast) on their first visit and on the other visit they will be asked to eat the meal in the reverse order. The order in which this occurs will be randomised and each participant will act as their own control. Scrambled egg was chosen as the protein and fat will be homogenously distributed (compared to boiled egg, for example). Wholemeal toast was chosen as, although lower glycaemic index and therefore less likely to expeditiously raise blood glucose than toasted white bread, it will be more consistent with the participants' existing dietary needs."
