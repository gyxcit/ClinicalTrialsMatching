          "briefSummary": "Eye disease affects 2.2 billion people globally, which in turn adversely affects schooling, economic productivity, and participation in social life. The primary conditions contributing to visual impairment and blindness include cataracts, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy (DR), refractive error, and presbyopia. Early detection of eye disease can provide substantial benefits in prompting treatment to reduce progression and mitigate disability.\n\nCompared with other regions, South Asia has the most cases of visual impairment due to cataracts and uncorrected refractive error. The combination of poverty, poor living and working environments, and limited health care access have long endangered eye health in Bangladesh. Coastal Bangladesh is particularly impacted by eye disease due to economic deprivation and limited healthcare access. The coastal population mostly works in fishing and agriculture, have prolonged sunlight exposure, and inadequate occupational eye protection. This low-lying region, with 35 million people, is especially vulnerable to climate disasters and global warming. High rates of chronic disease, especially diabetes mellitus Type 2 and hypertension, coupled with limited screening and treatment, shape the area's health profile, with the increasing prevalence of eye diseases such as DR, glaucoma, and visual impairment.\n\nTo address the issues of poor health, accessibility, and affordability of eye care, Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI)-assisted fundus imaging, can be applied in eye screening. Medical AI applications have the potential to improve the quality and efficiency of healthcare, reduce healthcare costs, optimize treatment plans, and bolster the development of primary healthcare. They can identify presumptive DR, hypertensive retinopathy (HR), AMD, and glaucoma by analyzing the retina and optic disc of fundus images with moderate accuracy and high efficiency, thus helping address the lack of local eye care professionals.\n\nData Yakka developed a human-AI collaboration that delivers affordable and transformative community-based eye screening to underserved communities in the coastal Bangladesh region of Char Fasson. The \"Amar Chokh Amar Alo\" (My Eyes, My Light) initiative creates and implements comprehensive eye screening that combines AI-assisted eye screening and grassroots partnerships with trusted non-health non-governmental organizations (NGOs). It has three objectives: 1) Enhancing accessibility and affordability of eye screening; 2) Supporting high quality and efficient treatment of those problems detected via screening, 3) Collecting fundus images to refine or train AI algorithms in the future. This project was designed to evaluate the feasibility, performance, equity, and cost of this model of eye screening and its implications for global eye disease.\n\nThe implementation of participant recruitment, data collection, screening, and follow-up was separated into twelve steps. This standardized framework ensured the integration of screening with data collection and follow-up eye care services. Based on risk stratification by diabetes, hypertension, age 50+ years, and/or optometrist recommendation, fundus imaging was offered selectively to higher-risk patients.",
          "detailedDescription": "Setting Location and Participants Selection of a target region within Bangladesh considered four factors that would facilitate successful screening: 1) Relatively high population density and adequate transportation network, 2) the presence of a Cyclone Preparedness Program (CPP) volunteer network, 3) An eye care hospital willing to serve referred clients, and 4) Support and assistance from local and regional government. Based on these criteria, the investigators selected and implemented the screening project in Char Fasson of coastal Bangladesh.\n\nChar Fasson is a sub-district (Upazila) of the Bhola District and has a population of 518,792. While the investigators initially considered another coastal sub-district of comparable size, Char Fasson was chosen because of data collection challenges in the original choice. Char Fasson showed greater levels of poverty and more limited healthcare access while governmental coordination was exemplary. Within Char Fasson, the investigators made special efforts to serve outlying, smaller islands within the sub-district.\n\nPartnership Team Successful delivery of the program relied on effective collaboration across a range of diverse partners, including major operational organizations, clinical affiliates, commercial suppliers, and technical advisors. The major partners responsible for day-to-day work included the organizer, Data Yakka (Palo Alto, California, USA) which is a healthcare technology company specializing in AI-assisted medical screening platforms and data management systems, the regional government (Char Fasson Upazila), the Bangladesh Disaster Preparedness Centre (BDPC, Dhaka), and the national government's Cyclone Preparedness Program (CPP, Dhaka). Among them, BDPC provided personnel for program execution and supervision while CPP mobilized its volunteers for paid work in clinical site staffing and program outreach to remote areas. The total number of CPP community volunteers in coastal Bangladesh is around 76,000, with 3,300 in Char Fasson.\n\nThe main clinical partner was the Dr. K. Zaman Bangladesh National Society for the Blind Eye Hospital (BNSB, Mymensingh, Bangladesh), which provided on-site ophthalmology and optometry staffing as well as remote fundus image review and clinical consultation as needed. The Ad-din Medical College Hospital (Dhaka) provided additional resources. Clients requiring cataract surgery were referred to regional facilities vetted by BNSB or to services provided by the Ad-Din Hospital.\n\nCommercial supplier partners included VisionSpring (New York, New York, USA), a not-for-profit organization providing low-cost reading glasses that the program distributed free to those in need, Topcon Corporation (Tokyo, Japan) for its NW-500 robotic fundus imaging camera, and Aurolab (Madurai, India) for its HAWK I T2 slit lamp examination device. Thirona Retina (Nijmegen, Netherlands) supplied its RetCAD AI software algorithms for the detection of suspected DR, AMD, and glaucoma. The software evaluates image quality, generates heatmaps with deep learning, and provides disease likelihood scores. Previous research demonstrated that RetCAD showed high performance: 96% sensitivity and 94% specificity on the Messidor-2 dataset for DR, 95% sensitivity and 97% specificity on the private1 dataset for AMD, and 95% sensitivity and 86% specificity on the REFUGE dataset for glaucoma. Technical advisors, including Stanford University (Palo Alto, California, USA), Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital (Melbourne, Australia), and Glaucoma Australia (Sydney, Australia), shared their expertise, guided technical program components, and provided external clinical oversight and case-by-case review for complex or unclear diagnosis.\n\nData security The security and integrity of patient data was ensured through multiple layers of protection. The secure, encrypted patient data portal was developed by Data Yakka using Java (Oracle, Austin, Texas, USA) with Angular for data entry and Spring Boot for backend micro services management, including a program dashboard for real-time monitoring. Patient information was securely stored in PostgreSQL RDS (Amazon Web Services, Seattle, Washington, USA), while fundus images were stored in Amazon S3 with server-side encryption using managed keys. This protected all sensitive data from unauthorized access. Personal identifiers were segregated from clinical details to enhance patient privacy. Keycloak was implemented for secure authentication and authorization. A comprehensive audit trail was maintained, logging all user interactions (access, edits, and deletions) to ensure compliance with the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the U.S.'s Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). This also provided immediate detection of potential data security threats. Finally, to enhance system reliability, the investigators deployed Multi-AZ, which enabled automatic failover, high availability in case of hardware disruptions, and disaster recovery.\n\nEthical Considerations Ethical approval was obtained from the Institutional Ethical Committee of BNSB (reference date/number 118/2025). To comply with Bangladesh's data regulatory policies, consent was waived for most components of the screening process and was obtained for the fundus images (retina and optic disc) because they constitute personal health information, are stored electronically, and their use in the future is anticipated. Before taking fundus images, screening staff described the reason, purpose, acquisition, use, confidential storage, deletion, and withdrawal mechanism for the fundus images and the required personal information. Informed consent was then obtained from the participants, including their signatures to verify their voluntary participation. The study was conducted in strict compliance with Declaration of Helsinki and ethical international and country-specific requirements.\n\n2.2 Screening \\& Care Process Timeline The program duration was planned for 10 months. This paper covers the program's initial stage and is current as of early April 2025. From October to December 2024, the investigators carried out a three-month-long creation and refinement of the screening model and electronic platform. Next, in December 2024, the model was tested and further enhanced during a pre-opening testing period for troubleshooting and initial data collection. Between January 2025 and July 2025, full-time data collection is planned with participant recruitment and screening then follow-up.\n\nProcess The implementation of participant recruitment, data collection, screening, and follow-up was separated into twelve steps. This standardized framework ensured the integration of screening with data collection and follow-up eye care services. Fundus imaging was offered selectively to higher-risk patients with specific criteria including: random blood glucose \\>7.9 millimoles per liter (mmol/L), blood pressure ≥140/90 millimeters of Mercury (mmHg), age ≥50 years, or clinical suspicion of retinal pathology based on patient report or slit lamp examination.\n\nData Analysis Statistical analyses will be performed using Microsoft Excel. After data collection and cleaning, the investigators calculated descriptive statistics, including percentages, means, and standard deviations (SD), to analyze proportions, central tendency, and dispersion of demographic and diagnostic data. For statistical comparisons, the calculations for statistical significance will use 2-tailed t-tests with a threshold of p\\<0.05 considered statistically significant. Eye condition diagnosis was based on the presence of a condition in either one or both eyes.\n\nEstimates of cost will initially calculate costs associated with the first 8000 screened individuals. The investigators also projected trends in both screening numbers and costs through a hypothetical 6-month time point by extrapolating screening numbers and variable costs of the program to 6 months. Fixed costs are non-recurring, volume-independent expenses, including program computers, blood pressure and blood glucose measurement devices, and fundus imaging and slit lamp equipment. Variable costs include consumables and operation fees based on unit usage, calculated by multiplying unit costs by the total screening, such as consumable testing costs, eyeglasses distribution, and office supplies. Per-person cost breakdown followed a dual-tier approach: fixed costs were evenly allocated among all screened individuals, while marginal cost reflected the average variable expenditure per screening."

          "briefSummary": "Obesity is at risk for the development of chronic kidney disease but the involved mechanisms are not known (Navarro et al. 2015). Establishing the link between obesity and kidney damage is difficult. Indeed, kidney function measurement lacks precision in obese people (Lemoine et al. 2014) and requires expensive methods such as measurement of 99mTc-DTPA clearance. Biopsies are too invasive for the detection of emerging kidney damage or for the following of the kidney function. Therefore new tools are required for the early identification of at risk individuals for the kidney damage complication.\n\nMesenchymal stem cells may represent such a relevant tool. These cells are present in a large number of organs, including kidney (Costa et al. 2020).\n\nIn addition to be differentiated cells progenitors (Dominici et al. 2006), they also support immunosuppressive, anti-fibrotic and pro-angiogenic functions that have been used for the treatment of kidney fibrosis (Usunier et al. 2014). Therefore, mesenchymal stem cells contribute to tissue homeostasis and their alterations may reflect organ dysfunctions. Indeed, mesenchymal stem cells from obese adipose tissue lose their immunosuppressive (Serena et al. 2016) and differentiation (Gustafson et al. 2009) functions and contribute to fibrosis (Keophiphath et al. 2009) and inflammation (Lee et al. 2010; Gustafson, Nerstedt, et Smith 2019). It is thus probable that kidney dysfunctions are associated with functional alterations of kidney mesenchymal stem cells.\n\nThe collection of mesenchymal stem cells from kidney can easily be performed from urine and next cultivated for amplification. They are called urine stem cells (USC).\n\nFrom our experience with obese mouse adipose stem cells, we observed that functional changes of stem cells preceded adipose tissue dysfunctions. Functional signatures of mesenchymal stem cells are thus representative of changes occuring in the function of the tissue notably in answer to obesity. These features could be used to identify obese people presenting ongoing alterations of kidney function, before clinical manifestations of kidney dysfunction. Because kidney mesenchymal stem cells are easy to isolate from urine, their collection is compatible with the follow up of patients and can be applied to a large number of individuals, including the younger. USC could represent a valuable tool to detect progression towards kidney damage.\n\nIn this project we plan to analyse USC alterations induced by obesity and to identify signatures associated with the progression towards kidney damage and type 2 diabetes. The goal is to evaluate USC as potential marker for the non invasive monitoring of patients in answer to a need that is not achieved by the present available approaches."

          "detailedDescription": "Investigators intend to transplant 4 Type 1 Diabetes mellitus patients with compromised vision in one or both eyes due to diabetic or other complications, and who have already received kidney transplantation (i.e., already on immunosuppression). Transplantation of allogeneic pancreatic human islets will be performed into the anterior chamber of a single eye with compromised vision. Since the recipients are already immunosuppressed due to maintenance therapy for the kidney graft, investigators will only use non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID).\n\nOnly in case of uncontrolled reaction, steroid should be used under guidance of the ophthalmologists. Investigators will neither inject local immunosuppressive drugs nor change ongoing immunosuppressive medication in the pilot study.\n\nThe overall objective is to establish that transplantation of allogeneic pancreatic islet cells into the anterior chamber of a severely visual impaired diabetic human eye is safe and does not cause ophthalmic or systemic complications. Furthermore, the change in insulin production, glucose control and hypoglycaemia awareness will be assessed.\n\nIn this pilot study investigators aim to gain experience in the technique, to obtain preliminary data on the amount of insulin that can be expected per transplanted islet equivalent (IEQ) and observe possible local reactions. These data will help to design a future larger study in patients without visual impairment."

          "detailedDescription": "Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the most common and specific complication of DM. It is one of the leading causes of preventable blindness in the adult working population. (1) DR was the fifth leading cause of blindness and of moderate and severe vision impairment.\n\nGlobal prevalence of diabetic retinopathy was 22.27% and prevalence was highest in Africa (35.90%). (1)\n\nFortunately, much of the visual loss from DR is preventable, and the rates of vision loss from diabetes and DR have declined over the past few decades due to advances in ocular disease assessment, screening, imaging and treatment in recent years. (2)\n\nThe outer third of the retina gets oxygen and nutrients from choroid. The three vascular layers of choroid are chorio capillaries layer, Sattler layer and Haller layer. (3)\n\nA healthy choroid is essential for retinal function by continuous perfusion into the outer retina, which plays critical roles in thermoregulation of the retina, maintenance of the anatomic position of the retina, removal of residues, and secretion of growth factors. (4-5)\n\nThe vascular choroid changes of the diabetic patients are quite similar to those seen in DR, such as increased vascular tortuosity, vascular outpouchings, microaneurysms, nonperfusion areas, vascular dilations and narrowing, and choroidal neovascularization. (6)\n\nUntil recently, the choroid could only be evaluated by indocyanine green angiography, laser Doppler flowmetry, and ultrasonography. (6) Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a non-invasive imaging modality, which is used in acquiring high-resolution sections of retina. (5)"

          "briefSummary": "Oleanolic acid (OA), is a natural component of many plant food and medicinal herbs, which has shown to exert in experimental models hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic effects, and also a cytoprotective action against oxidative and chemotoxic stress underlying Type II Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM).Today it is known that OA shares mechanisms of action with metformin and other drugs of choice for the treatment of diabetes. Therefore, the OLTRAD (OLeanolic acid TReAtment for type 2 Diabetes) Study, a prospective, parallel group, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial with 100 participants, has been designed to demonstrate that the regular intake of an OA-enriched functional olive oil is effective as an adjuvant to metformin antidiabetic drug therapy. The hypothesis is that the inclusion of this functional olive oil in the diet will enhance the effects of the pharmacological treatment in diabetic patients, and may even reduce the need for prescription of such medications.",
          "detailedDescription": "TRIAL DESIGN The OLTRAD Study is a prospective, parallel group, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial designed to demonstrate that the regular intake of an OA-enriched functional olive oil is effective as an adjunct to metformin therapy (as monotherapy or in combination with other antidiabetic drugs) in the metabolic control of T2DM patients. The effect of the OA-enriched olive oil will be compared with that of the control oil, which consists of the same commercial olive oil not fortified in the triterpene.\n\nA total of 100 volunteers of both sex will be selected from among the T2DM patients treated at the Endocrinology and Nutrition Service of the 'Virgen del Rocío' University Hospital (Seville, SPAIN).\n\nSAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION Serum glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) is adopted as the main quantitative variable for the analysis of glycemic control. The null hypothesis stated in the trial design is that the OA-based dietary intervention will reduce the baseline serum HbA1c levels of patients by at least 7%, compared to the control group. To test this one-sided hypothesis test with a 95% confidence level (α risk = 0.05) and 95% power (β risk = 0.05), a sample size of 44 volunteers per group is required. However, due to the characteristics of the study (a long-term lifestyle intervention), participant losses of up to 15% can be assumed, resulting in an adjusted sample size of 50 individuals per group.\n\nRANDOMIZATION Once recruited, the 100 T2DM patients will be randomly assigned to one of the two study groups. Fifty individuals will be assigned to the intervention group, which will ingest the OA-enriched functional olive oil, whereas the other 50 volunteers will be assigned to the control group, which will receive the same non-enriched olive oil. At the time of admission, the study nursing staff will request by telephone the clinical coordinator of the trial (Principal Investigator 2 of the Project) the assignment of participants to the study groups (centralized randomization). Allocation to these groups will be made using computer generated tables of random numbers. Four randomization strata will be constructed by sex and age (cuttof 50 years).\n\nINTERVENTION Participants will be instructed to ingest 55 mL/day of the assigned oil, preferably raw and freely distributed among the three main meals. Both the OA-enriched olive oil and the control oil will be delivered labeled with alphanumeric codes, the correspondence of which will only be known by the Principal Investigator 1 of the project. This ensures blinding of the clinical researchers and participants with respect to the type of olive oil assigned.\n\nFOLLOW-UP Participants in the clinical trial will be followed up for 12 months from enrollment, according to a plan of quarterly visits.\n\nAt the time of recruitment and every three months thereafter, participants will be measured for anthropometric, blood pressure, and heart rate measurements. They will also be asked about gastrointestinal disorders or other types of complaints, and will complete a questionnaire on lifestyle (diet, physical activity, alcohol and tobacco use), medical conditions, and medication use.\n\nAlso at the beginning of participation in the study and every three months thereafter, fasting blood samples will be drawn from the cubital vein, which will be collected in sterile plastic tubes with a vacuum system. Similarly, participants will provide aliquots of their first morning urine in sterile plastic tubes. The analytical determinations in blood and urine will be carried out in the Clinical Biochemistry and Analysis Laboratory of the 'Virgen del Rocío' University Hospital in Seville (HUVR).\n\nIn addition, aliquots of plasma will be sent to the 'Instituto de la Grasa' (IG-CSIC) for complementary biochemical determinations. Laboratory technicians from both institutions will receive the samples identified with alphanumeric ID codes and, therefore, will be blinded to the intervention groups.\n\nIn these quarterly visits, volunteers will participate in sessions of the nutritional education program and will receive 6 L of the assigned oil for free. Adherence to the dietary intervention will be assessed quarterly through the Haynes-Sackett's self-reported compliance test and the return of empty bottles presumably consumed.\n\nThe primary outcome of the trial is the improvement in glycemic control, assessed by the evolution of HbA1c. As secondary results, we will obtain data on anthropometric and clinical variables, as well as on biochemical parameters of blood and urine.\n\nANAMNESIS AND CLINICAL EXAMINATION OF PARTICIPANTS The medical researchers of the project have access to the electronic medical records of the participants in the platform DIRAYA of the Andalusian Health Service, and will carry out the anamnesis and physical examination of the participants, which will include vital data and general medical and surgical history, as well as the pharmacological treatments followed. Information will also be obtained on lifestyle, perception of their own body image, diet, and the type and intensity of physical activity. In addition, a general clinical examination will be carried out including general appearance and inspection of hands and arms, feet and legs, skin, face, eyes, mouth, neck, abdomen, edema, lymph nodes, and vital signs (temperature, pulse, respiratory rate and blood pressure).\n\nANTHROPOMETRIC STUDY AND BODY COMPOSITION The anthropometric study will include the determination of total body weight, height, body mass index (BMI), as well as waist and hip circumferences. The study and evaluation of these variables will be carried out according to the guidelines of the International Society for the Advancement of Kinanthropometry (ISAK). The study of body composition will be carried out by electrical bioimpedance. Fat mass, lean mass, muscle mass, total water, bone mass, basal metabolism, and visceral fat will be quantified with this technique, using validated prediction equations adjusted for age and sex.\n\nASSESSMENT OF FOOD INTAKE AND NUTRITIONAL TRAINING A nutritional education program will be implemented to assess the food intake of the participants and reinforce compliance with the dietary recommendations given. To measure food intake, we will use the food intake registration form designed by the University of Navarra (Spain) and used successfully in other trials, such as the PREvención con DIeta MEDiterránea (PREDIMED) study. This form is a validated tool that quantifies food intake in terms of food portions or food groups for adults living in Spain. On the other hand, all the participants will join workshops where they will receive specific dietary recommendations for patients with T2DM, and they will be instructed on a healthy diet, the best food options and adequate portions, limiting highly processed foods, cakes, sugar, fatty foods as well as sugary and alcoholic beverages. Additionally, patients will gain information on recipes, seasonal shopping lists, and the use of olive oil for cooking and dressing. The eating habits of the participants will be analyzed quarterly by means of a 24-hour recall questionnaire. The 'NUTRIUM' software (https://nutrium.com/; Braga; Portugal) for the nutritional evaluation of the diets will be used.\n\nBLOOD BIOCHEMISTRY IN HUVR In ulnar blood samples, determinations related to circulating lipids \\[total triglycerides, total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, total apolipoprotein B and lipoprotein A\\]; glucose homeostasis \\[glycemia, insulinemia, C-peptide, HOMA-IR index, HbA1c\\]; oxidative stress and inflammation \\[uric acid, bilirubin, malondialdehyde, ultrasensitive C-reactive protein, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)\\], as well as those associated with liver and kidney damage \\[lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), liver transaminases (ALT, AST, GGT ) and creatinine\\] will be performed.\n\nPlasma level of vitamin B12 will be also assessed. In addition, the possible appearance of liver fibrosis will be evaluated through the Hepamet Fibrosis Score, a non-invasive method that calculates a score taking into account factors such as age, sex, presence of diabetes, glucose levels, insulin, albumin, platelets, and AST. This tool, designed by the Seville Institute of Biomedicine (IBiS), is indicated to assess suspected fibrosis in patients with obesity, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, hepatic steatosis, and/or abnormal liver function markers. The method offers diagnostic reliability and a cost/benefit ratio that is superior to other methods, such as the FIB-4 and the NAFLD Fibrosis Score.\n\nCONTINUOUS BLOOD GLUCOSE MONITORING Plasma glucose will be continuously monitored using the 'FreeStyle Libre' subcutaneous system (ABBOTT Diagnostics; Chicago, IL.; USA). The sensors will be attached to the participants at two times throughout the trial: at baseline and after 12 months of follow-up, and will collect data for 48 hours. With this system, different glycemic parameters will be determined, such as the area under the curve (AUC), the mean amplitude of the glycemic excursion (MAGE), the mean glycemia, as well as the standard deviation (SD) and the coefficient of variation (CV).\n\nPLASMA BIOCHEMISTRY IN IG-CSIC The investigators of the IG-CSIC will perform a number of complementary determinations in plasma samples, such as the plasmatic concentrations of OA, the glutathione (GSH and GSSG) levels, the fatty acid composition, serum adipokines (ceruloplasmin, adiponectin, leptin, resistin, and ghrelin). Serum Antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase) and proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6) will also be determined.\n\nOn the other hand, the VLDL fraction of plasma lipoproteins will be isolated by ultracentrifugation (230,000 × g for 18 h at 4 °C). In these particles, the total content of fatty acids, triglycerides, diglycerides, phospholipids and total Apolipoprotein B will be measured.\n\nURINE ANALYSIS The first morning urine samples will be analyzed for the usual physical, chemical, and microscopic determinations (pH, density, glycosuria, ketones, nitrites, urobilinogen, bilirubin, sediment, leukocytes, microalbuminuria/g creatinine). The determination of these parameters will also be carried out in the facilities of the Clinical Biochemistry and Analysis Laboratory of the 'Virgen del Rocío' University Hospitals in Seville.\n\nSTATISTICAL ANALYSIS The trial will be conducted according to the intention-to-treat (ITT) principle. Qualitative variables will be expressed by their absolute and relative frequencies, whereas the quantitative ones with normal distribution will be expressed by the mean and standard deviation and those with non-normal distribution by the median and interquartile range (IQR). Comparisons between study groups for qualitative variables will be performed with the Chi-square and McNemar's tests, whereas comparisons for quantitative variables will be executed with the Student's t-test and ANOVA. The homogeneity of the populations included in the allocation groups will be evaluated using theMann-Whitney-Wilcoxon U-test. All P-values will be two-tailed at α = 0.05. Statistical analysis will be performed with SPSS 27 (IBM SPSS Statistics, NY, USA) software"

While early patient and graft survival are excellent, long-term outcomes continue to be challenging. Patient death with existing kidney graft function occurs in about half of all recipients over time. This is primarily due to the development of cardiovascular disease in a patient population with multiple preexisting cardiac disease risk factors. There has been little progress in improving outcomes in this area for over two decades. Recent studies in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients using SGLT2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), regardless of the presence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), results in both kidney protective and cardiac protective impacts and improved patient outcomes. However, kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) were excluded from these clinical trials due to concerns that these agents promote infection, diminish graft function, and may alter immunosuppressive drug levels that are the mainstay of patient's transplant therapy. There are limited published data of SGLT2i treatment of selected KTRs.",
          "detailedDescription": "Background: Kidney transplantation improves the health and quality of life for those veterans with end stage kidney disease (ESKD). While early patient and graft survival are excellent, long-term outcomes continue to be challenging. Patient death with existing kidney graft function occurs in about half of all recipients over time. This is primarily due to the development of cardiovascular disease in a patient population with multiple preexisting cardiac disease risk factors. There has been little progress in improving outcomes in this area for over two decades. Recent studies in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients using SGLT2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), regardless of the presence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), results in both kidney protective and cardiac protective impacts and improved patient outcomes. However, kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) were excluded from these clinical trials due to concerns that these agents promote infection, diminish graft function, and may alter immunosuppressive drug levels that are the mainstay of patient's transplant therapy. There are limited published data of SGLT2i treatment of selected KTRs.\n\nObjective: The goal of this submission is to examine the safety and efficacy of SGLT2i therapy in Veterans with KTRs with and without T2DM. The hypothesis is treatment with SGLT2i will lead to improvements in graft and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease, with acceptable side effect profile.\n\nMethods: To test this hypothesis, the investigators will execute a multicenter clinical trial at 5 VA medical centers, including 4 that serve as primary kidney transplant programs. The multidisciplinary research team includes transplant medical and surgical expertise, diabetology, and informatics and statistical support familiar with VA data systems. In open label fashion, the investigators will treat eligible KTRs and comprehensively assess adverse and serious adverse event data, as well as assess any untoward impacts on graft function and diabetes management. Secondly, the investigators will utilize VA data from the VINCI corporate data warehouse to develop a control cohort of Veterans with KTRs with and without T2DM, not treated with SGLT2i. The investigators will utilize propensity score matching to reduce bias that may occur in observational studies. With this strategy, the investigators will further address the potential beneficial impact of SGLT2i treatment on cardiovascular outcomes, as well as kidney disease progression in the transplanted kidney. The investigators will also analyze the cost impact of using this agent in this patient population, in terms of hospitalizations, unanticipated procedures, and CKD management.\n\nFindings: These studies will provide new information to the transplant community for both Veteran and non-Veteran alike, with a detailed assessment of safety and feasibility of this agent class using a pragmatic approach to transplant care. These results will translate into an opportunity to mitigate late graft loss in this patient population, and a potential breakthrough in clinical care that to date has been unrecognized."

          "briefSummary": "The aim of the Check@Home consortium is to set up a roadmap and infrastructure for a program to early detect atrial fibrillation and chronic kidney disease in the general population.\n\nThis will be a population-based screening with a phased implementation and an iterative design in four regions in the Netherlands (Breda, Utrecht, Arnhem, Eindhoven). In total, a random sample of 160,000 people (aged 50-75 years) will be invited to participate in the study and another random sample of 160,000 people with the same characteristics will be included in the control group in which no screening will be offered.\n\nThe overall screening program will consist of three phases: a home-based testing phase, diagnostic screening phase, and a treatment phase:\n\n* Phase 1: Subjects will be invited for a home-based screening that includes home-based testing; urine collection for detection of elevated albuminuria, and a heart rhythm measurement using a smartphone app for detection of atrial fibrillation.\n* Phase 2: Depending on the results on these home-based tests, subjects will be invited for further screening in a diagnostic screening facility. During this visit, physical data will be collected (height, weight, waist circumference, blood pressure, heart rhythm), blood will be drawn, and urine will be collected for the assessment of parameters that are indicative of a cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, type 2 diabetes or their risk factors. Participants will receive a questionnaire that include questions on demographics, educational level, disease history, medication use, health literacy, and quality of life.\n* Phase 3: Based on the results of the diagnostic screening, participants may be referred to their general practitioner for appropriate treatment (lifestyle advice/medication) according to the prevailing guidelines.\n\nThe primary study outcomes are:\n\nOverall effectiveness of population based screening on atrial fibrillation and chronic kidney disease in subjects aged 50-75 years, based on:\n\n* Participation rate of different screening strategies and phases;\n* Yield of the screening (number of subjects with (newly) diagnosed disease and risk factors);\n* Effectiveness of the atrial fibrillation screening, compared with standard care, based on the incidence of ischemic stroke);\n* Effectiveness of the albuminuria screening, compared with standard care, based on the incidence of kidney failure events and Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE).",
          "detailedDescription": "Background:\n\nCurrently, in the Netherlands there is no structured national approach for the early detection of cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, and type 2 diabetes in the general population, despite the social and economic impact of these disorders. Detecting these chronic conditions at an early stage could allow for adequate and early treatment to prevent the progression of these conditions and their complications, thereby reducing the societal and economic burden caused by these chronic diseases.\n\nObjective of the study:\n\nTo investigate whether population-based screening of subjects aged 50-75 years can contribute to early detection and treatment of atrial fibrillation and chronic kidney disease (defined by elevated albuminuria), and thereby can contribute to prevention of the morbidity and mortality related to these diseases. This will be done by evaluating the participation rate, yield, and (cost-)effectiveness of the screening compared with standard care. Furthermore, the project aims to evaluate options for broader screening, including the early detection of heart failure, coronary artery disease, and type 2 diabetes.\n\nStudy design:\n\nThis will be a population-based screening with a phased implementation and an iterative design in four regions in the Netherlands (Breda, Utrecht, Arnhem, Eindhoven).\n\nParticipants will be invited for a home-based screening (phase 1) that includes home-based testing; urine collection for detection of elevated albuminuria as indicator of chronic kidney disease, and a heart rhythm measurement using a smartphone app for detection of atrial fibrillation. Both home-based tests will be performed with CE-marked medical devices used according to their intended use. A subset of the population will also receive a short questionnaire. Depending on the results of the home-based tests, subjects might be invited for further screening in a diagnostic screening facility (phase 2). During this visit, physical data (height, weight, waist circumference, blood pressure, heart rhythm) will be collected, blood will be drawn, and urine will be collected for the assessment of parameters that are indicative of a cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, type 2 diabetes or their risk factors. Participants will receive a questionnaire that includes questions on demographics, educational level, disease history, medication use, health literacy, and quality of life. Based on the results of the diagnostic screening, participants may be referred to their general practitioner for appropriate treatment (lifestyle advice/medication) according to the prevailing guidelines. It is planned that in a future protocol amendment an alternative treatment trajectory will be added in which participants may receive further treatment in the diagnostic screening facility.\n\nStudy population:\n\nIn total, a random sample of 160,000 people (aged 50-75 years) living in one of the four selected regions in the Netherlands will be invited to participate in the study. Another random sample of 160,000 people (aged 50-75 years) living in one of the four selected regions in the Netherlands will be included in the control group in which no screening will be offered."

          "briefSummary": "The purpose of this research is to evaluate novel technologies for the assessment of ocular structure and function, including the scanning device called Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT). We will test the OCT and other devices in their ability to image diseases of the eye and also compare the measurements made with OCT to those of other imaging and visual field devices approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). OCT may be useful for the early diagnosis and monitoring of a variety of types of eye diseases",
          "detailedDescription": "Objective:\n\nThe purpose of this research is to evaluate a new technology, optical coherence tomography (OCT), to image diseases of the eye and to compare the measurements obtained using OCT with those of other imaging and visual field devices. OCT may be useful for the early diagnosis and monitoring of a variety of eye diseases such as age-related macular degeneration (ARMD), glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, macular edema, and other pathologies.\n\nSpecific Aims:\n\nThere are four sub-studies: cross-sectional, longitudinal, reproducibility, and an Alzheimer's Disease (AD) sub-study. The cross-sectional and longitudinal arms study the effectiveness of the OCT technology in terms of detecting and monitoring eye diseases. The reproducibility study is designed to test the measurement likeness of the OCT. The AD sub-study will use high resolution ocular imaging technologies to determine ocular biomarkers for sensitive detection of AD.\n\nBackground:\n\nThis is a continuation of an ongoing study from the New England Eye Center (NEEC), Tufts Medical Center, Boston, MA. This study started when our research group was located at NEEC and in collaboration with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) where we conducted the first clinical studies with OCT. The first investigation using OCT was published in Science in 1991 and showed in vitro imaging of the human retina and atherosclerotic plaque. We developed an OCT prototype system for performing preliminary ophthalmic clinical studies and in 1993, began clinical OCT imaging studies.\n\nThe prototype ophthalmic OCT instrument acquired OCT images of the retina with an axial resolution of 10µm within an acquisition time of 2.5 sec. The OCT imaging system was integrated with a slit-lamp biomicroscope for in vivo tomography of the anterior and posterior eye. The beam is directed into the eye using computer controlled galvonometric scanners, which can scan arbitrary transverse patterns. The beam focus is coincident with the slit-lamp image plane to permit simultaneous scanning and visualization of the eye through the slit-lamp or via a CCD camera. For tomography of the anterior eye, the microscope is focused directly on the structure, while for retinal imaging, a lens relay images of the retina onto the slit-lamp image plane. A computer provides real-time display of the tomogram, image processing, and data management.\n\nOCT technology was patented and subsequently transferred to industry (Zeiss Humphrey Systems, CA). Our prototype ophthalmic OCT system was developed into a clinical instrument and was introduced into the ophthalmic market in 1996. The commercial OCT technology has an axial resolution of 10 µm and can acquire a 100 transverse pixel retinal tomogram in 1 second. A third generation ophthalmic OCT imaging device, OCT3, was introduced three years ago. OCT imaging is now used as a standard diagnostic procedure as part of an ophthalmic examination for many retina and glaucoma patients at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) Eye Center and New England Eye Center (NEEC). OCT imaging is in use in major research and clinical centers internationally. The OCT has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in ophthalmology.\n\nSignificance:\n\nOCT enables tissue pathology to be imaged in situ and in real time with a resolution approaching that of conventional histopathology but without the need for excising and processing specimens. OCT provides a quantitative method of directly measuring ocular structures with high precision and could provide an objective, early diagnosis for glaucoma, age related macular degeneration (ARMD), diabetic retinopathy, macular edema, and other pathologies. Extensive studies have been performed with OCT in cross-sectional as well as longitudinal setting. In this ongoing protocol, our objective is to continue these studies using the commercial ophthalmic OCT imaging instruments to develop methods for early detection and improve longitudinal assessment for the above mentioned ocular pathologies."

          "briefSummary": "Vegetarian diets have been associated with a reduced risk of preventable diseases such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. These effects may be mediated through direct or indirect pathways. Although the high intakes of nuts, legumes, dietary fibre, whole grains, and unsaturated plant oils have each individually been associated with lower risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, so too has the displacement of red meats, processed meats, and saturated animal fats. One of the most important considerations in moving from animal-based diets to more plant-based diets is the replacement of animal proteins (e.g. meat, fish, dairy, eggs) with vegetable proteins (e.g. legumes, nuts, and seeds). It is unclear whether this particular replacement alone results in advantages for metabolic and cardiovascular health. To improve evidence-based guidance for dietary guidelines and health claims development, we propose to conduct a series of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of the effect of plant-based protein in exchange for animal protein on blood lipids, glycemic control, blood pressure, body weight, uric acid, markers of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and kidney function and injury. The systematic review process allows the combining of the results from many small studies in order to arrive at a pooled estimate, similar to a weighted average, of the true effect. The investigators will be able to explore whether the effects of replacing animal-based protein for plant-based protein hold true across different sexes, age groups, and background disease states and whether the effect depends on the protein source, dose, or background diet. The findings of this proposed knowledge synthesis will help improve the health of Canadians through informing recommendations for the general public, as well as those at risk of heart disease and diabetes.",
          "detailedDescription": "Background: Vegetarian diets have been associated with a reduced risk of preventable cardiometabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. It is unclear whether the replacement of animal protein with vegetable protein has cardiometabolic advantages.\n\nObjectives: To improve evidence-based guidance for dietary guidelines and health claims development, we propose to conduct a series of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of the effects of plant-based protein in replacement for animal protein on cardiometabolic risk factors including: (1) blood lipids, (2) glycemic control, (3) blood pressure, (4) body weight, (5) uric acid, (6) markers of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), (7) kidney function and injury, and (8) CRP as an inflammation marker.\n\nDesign: The planning and conduct of the proposed meta-analyses will follow the Cochrane handbook for systematic reviews of interventions. The reporting will follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.\n\nData sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials will be searched using appropriate search terms.\n\nStudy selection: Long term (≥ 3 weeks), randomized, controlled trials that investigate the effect of exchange of plant proteins for animal proteins on the outcomes previously mentioned in humans will be included. Studies that have an acute feeding design, are not randomized, or lack a suitable control will not be included. Both isocaloric and non-isocaloric studies will be included.\n\nData extraction: Independent investigators (≥2) will extract information about study design, sample size, subject characteristics, pulse form, dose, follow-up, and the composition of the background diets. Mean±SEM values will be extracted for all outcomes. Standard computations and imputations will be used to derive missing variance data. Risk of bias and study quality will be assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool and the Heyland Methodological Quality Score (MQS), respectively.\n\nOutcomes: The proposed syntheses will each assess a set of outcomes related to a different area of cardiometabolic risk: (1) blood lipids (established therapeutic targets for the prevention of cardiovascular disease - LDL-C, apo-B, non-HDL-C), (2) glycemic control (glycated blood proteins, fasting glucose and insulin, and Homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance \\[HOMA-IR\\]), (3) body weight, (4) uric acid, (5) blood pressure (systolic BP and diastolic BP), (6) markers of NAFLD (imaging and spectroscopy endpoints of liver fat and biomarkers of hepatocellular injury \\[transaminases\\]), (7) kidney injury and function (creatinine, urea, creatine clearance, estimated glomerular filtration rate \\[eGFR\\], albumin-to-creatine ratio \\[ACR\\], albuminuria, proteinuria) and (8) inflammation marker (CRP).\n\nData synthesis: Separate pooled analyses will be conducted for each area of cardiometabolic control using the Generic Inverse Variance method. Random-effects models will be used even in the absence of statistically significant between-study heterogeneity, as they yield more conservative summary effect estimates in the presence of residual heterogeneity. Exceptions will be made for the use of fixed-effects models where there is \\<5 included trials irrespective of heterogeneity or small trials are being pooled with larger more precise trials in the absence of statistically significant heterogeneity. Paired analyses will be applied to all crossover trials. Heterogeneity will be tested by Cochran's Q statistic and quantified by the I2 statistic. Sources of heterogeneity will be explored by sensitivity and subgroup analyses. A priori subgroup analyses will include study design, dose, vegetable protein type, animal protein comparator, follow-up, baseline values, and study quality. Significant unexplained heterogeneity will be investigated by additional post hoc subgroup analyses (e.g. age, sex, level of feeding control \\[metabolic, supplemented, dietary advice\\], washout in crossover trials, energy balance of the background diet, composition of the background diet \\[total % energy from fat, carbohydrate, protein\\], change in cholesterol intake, change in glycemic index, etc.). Meta-regression analyses will assess the significance of subgroups analyses. Publication bias will be investigated by the inspection of funnel plots and application of Egger's and Begg's tests.\n\nKnowledge translation plan: Results will be disseminated through traditional means such as interactive presentations at local, national, and international scientific meetings and publication in high impact factor journals. Innovative means such as webcasts with e-mail feedback mechanisms will also be used. Knowledge Users will act as knowledge brokers networking among opinion leaders and different adopter groups to increase awareness at each stage. Four Knowledge Users will also participate directly as members of nutrition guidelines committees. Target adopters will include the clinical practice, public health, industry, research communities, and patient groups. Feedback will be incorporated and used to guide analyses and improve key messages at each stage.\n\nSignificance: The proposed project will demonstrate that the improvement in long term health measures. This demonstration will aid in knowledge translation related to the effects of plant proteins on cardiometabolic risk, kidney disease management, and metabolic syndrome, strengthening the evidence-base for dietary recommendations and health claims and improving health outcomes through informing healthcare providers and patients, stimulating industry innovation, and guiding future research."

          "briefSummary": "The main objective of this study is to determine the efficacy, safety and utility of fully closed-loop glucose control in the home setting in adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D). This study builds on previous and on-going studies of closed-loop systems that have been performed in Cambridge in adults with type 2 diabetes in the inpatient and in the home setting and in children and adults with type 1 diabetes.\n\nThis is an open-label, multi-national, multi-centre, randomised, single-period parallel study, involving a run-in period followed by a 26-week intervention period during which glucose levels will be controlled either by a fully closed-loop system or by participants usual insulin therapy with continuous glucose monitoring. A total of up to 224 adults with type 2 diabetes using insulin will be recruited through outpatient diabetes clinics, primary care centres, social media advertising and other established methods at participating centres. Participants will receive appropriate training in the safe use of the study devices.\n\nThe primary outcome is the between group difference in HbA1c at 26 weeks. Other key outcomes include the time spent with glucose levels within, above and below the target glucose range (3.9-10.0mmol/L) and mean sensor glucose as recorded by CGM over the 26 weeks. Insulin requirements, body weight, renal and liver function will also be compared. Safety evaluation comprises severe hypoglycaemic episodes, and other adverse and serious adverse events. Human factors outcomes include CGM \\& closed-loop usage, questionnaires and semi-structured interviews.",
          "detailedDescription": "Purpose of clinical trial:\n\nTo determine the efficacy, safety and utility of fully closed-loop insulin delivery over 26 weeks in the home setting in adults with type 2 diabetes.\n\nStudy objectives:\n\nTo determine the efficacy, safety and utility of fully closed-loop insulin delivery over 26 weeks in the home setting in adults with type 2 diabetes.\n\n1. EFFICACY: The objective is to assess the ability of fully closed-loop insulin delivery to improve glucose control as measured by HbA1c (primary endpoint) and sensor glucose metrics.\n2. SAFETY: The objective is to evaluate the safety of fully closed-loop insulin delivery in terms of episodes and severity of hypoglycaemia, and nature and severity of other adverse events.\n3. UTILITY: The objective is to determine the acceptability and duration of use of the CGM and closed-loop system.\n4. HUMAN FACTORS: The objective is to assess cognitive, emotional, and behavioural characteristics of participants and their response to the closed-loop system using validated questionnaires and semi-structured interviews.\n\n   Participating clinical centres:\n\n   UK - Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. - Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, London\n\n   \\- Manchester Royal Infirmary, Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust\n\n   \\- King's College Hospital, King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, London\n\n   \\- Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust\n\n   \\- Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital, Norfolk and Norwich University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust\n\n   \\- University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust\n\n   Switzerland\n\n   \\- Inselspital, Bern University Hospital, Bern\n\n   France\n\n   \\- Centre Hospitalier Universitaire (CHU) de Toulouse\n\n   Germany\n\n   \\- Medical Center - University of Freiburg\n\n   Austria\n\n   \\- Medical University of Graz, Graz\n\n   Czech Republic\n\n   \\- Diabetes Centre, Institute for Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Prague\n\n   Sample Size:\n\n224 participants (112 per group) will be randomised. Recruitment will target a minimum quota of 25% of participants using basal insulin and a minimum quota of 60% of participants using multiple daily insulin injections.\n\nMaximum duration of study for a subject: 30 weeks\n\nRecruitment:\n\nParticipants will be recruited through outpatient diabetes clinics, primary care centres, social media advertising or other established methods at participating centres\n\nConsent:\n\nParticipants will be asked to provide written informed consent.\n\nBaseline Assessment:\n\nEligible participants will undergo baseline evaluation involving talking a medical history including demographics, height/weight, waist hip ratio and blood pressure measurement and blood samples for HbA1c, fasted lipid profile, renal and liver function. A urine albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR) will be performed, along with a urine pregnancy test in females of child-bearing age. Human factors questionnaires will be completed and a masked glucose sensor will be applied.\n\nRun-in Period:\n\nDuring a 2-3 week run-in period, participants will use their usual insulin therapy and wear a masked CGM system. At the end of the run-in period, for compliance, at least 10 days of CGM data needs to be recorded. CGM data during the run-in period will be used to assess baseline glucose control before the start of the intervention phase.\n\nRandomisation:\n\nEligible participants will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio using central randomisation software to fully closed-loop or standard insulin therapy with CGM for 26 weeks. Randomisation will be stratified by site and baseline HbA1c.\n\nFully closed loop insulin delivery (intervention arm):\n\nFollowing randomisation, participants in the closed-loop group will receive training on the study CGM, study insulin pump and closed-loop App during a 1-2 hour outpatient session. Competency on the use of the closed-loop system will be evaluated. Further training may be delivered as required. Participants will be advised to use the closed-loop system for the next 26 weeks.\n\nStandard insulin therapy with CGM (control arm):\n\nFollowing randomisation, participants in the control group will use their usual insulin therapy and the study CGM. Training on the use of the CGM will be provided. Participants will use standard insulin therapy and CGM for the next 26 weeks.\n\n3 month study visit: Weight, waist hip ratio and blood pressure will be measured and a blood sample will be taken for measurement of HbA1c, fasted lipid profile, renal and liver function. Data from the closed-loop system and CGM system will be reviewed. Human factors questionnaires will be completed.\n\nEnd of study assessments:\n\nWeight, waist hip ratio and blood pressure will be measured and a blood sample will be taken for measurement of HbA1c, fasted lipid profile, renal and liver function. Urinary ACR will be measured. Human factors questionnaires will be completed and a subset of participants will participate in interviews. Study devices will be returned and participants will resume their usual insulin therapy and standard glucose monitoring.\n\nProcedures for safety monitoring during trial:\n\nStandard operating procedures for monitoring and reporting of all adverse events and adverse device events will be in place, including serious adverse events (SAE), serious adverse device effects (SADE) and specific adverse events (AE) such as severe hypoglycaemia.\n\nA data safety and monitoring board (DSMB) will be informed of all serious adverse events and any unanticipated serious adverse device effects that occur during the study and will review compiled adverse event data at periodic intervals.\n\nCriteria for withdrawal of subjects on safety grounds:\n\nA participant may terminate participation in the study at any time without necessarily giving a reason and without any personal disadvantage. An investigator can stop the participation of a subject after consideration of the benefit/risk ratio. Possible reasons are:\n\n* Participant is unable to demonstrate safe use of study devices as judged by the investigator\n* Serious adverse events\n* Significant protocol violation or non-compliance\n* Decision by the investigator, or the Sponsor, that termination is in the participant's best medical interest\n* Pregnancy, planned pregnancy, or breast feeding\n* Allergic reaction to insulin or severe allergic reaction to adhesive surface of infusion set or glucose sensor\n* Technical grounds (e.g. participant relocates)"

This condition gives rise to various complications that can lead to diabetic retinopathy, foot ulcers, cardiac problems, and kidney damage. However, many of these complications can be mitigated by providing patients with accurate information concerning their diet, stress management, and weight control.\n\nThe recent advancements in Generative Artificial Intelligence-based chatbots have demonstrated their efficacy as intelligent assistants across various aspects of human life. In this study, we aim to assess the effectiveness of these Language Models in assisting patients. Our research plan entails the interaction between patients and chatbots like ChatGPT, both with and without human support, followed by evaluations of these interactions by specialists. Additionally, we will gather feedback from patients regarding their experiences and perceptions of the chatbot interactions."

          "detailedDescription": "Older adults with type 2 diabetes experience an accelerated rate of sarcopenia, which is the deterioration in muscle mass, strength and physical performance. Periods of disuse caused by illness or hospitalization cause rapid loss of muscle mass and strength, which negatively impact physical function upon re-ambulation. The impact of type 2 diabetes on acute muscle atrophy and recovery from disuse is a critical issue that has not been investigated.\n\nThe overall objectives of this study are to employ highly innovative methods in muscle biopsy specimens in order to decipher the temporal sequence by which mitochondrial dysfunction and lipotoxicity in older adults with pre-diabetes and type 2 diabetes impact atrophy and recovery of muscle mass, strength and physical function following bed rest. Older adults with and without pre-diabetes/type 2 diabetes will complete 10 days of strict bed rest followed by 4 weeks of ambulatory recovery. During bed rest muscle biopsies will be collected to determine mitochondrial function and lipid profile. During the recovery period the recovery of muscle mass, strength and physical function will be determined."

          "detailedDescription": "Optimal diabetes management is a delicate balance between treating hyperglycemia and avoiding the risk of sudden hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia is a common, recurring, feared, and neglected complication among endocrine emergencies in individuals with diabetes. Intensive glycemic control is very important in preventing microvascular and macrovascular complications of diabetes. However, hypoglycemia is a significant obstacle to effective treatment. Individuals with diabetes experience many chronic microvascular and macrovascular complications. The most challenging and frightening complication for individuals with diabetes and their families is hypoglycemia. Diabetics are afraid of experiencing hypoglycemia, and fear of hypoglycemia is a significant obstacle to achieving normoglycemia. Hypoglycemia in individuals with type 2 diabetes often occurs due to errors in self-management. Hypoglycemia limits the physical activities and daily living activities of individuals with diabetes. Hypoglycemia, which negatively affects the physiological and psychological health of individuals with diabetes, also reduces the quality of life of patients and their families. Hypoglycemia is also the most important limitation of diabetes treatment. As the severity of hypoglycemia increases, the quality of life of patients decreases. Approximately 25% of patients with type 2 diabetes treated with insulin for more than five years experience severe hypoglycemia. Impaired awareness of hypoglycemia is the weakening of the ability to perceive warning signs during hypoglycemia. Impaired awareness of hypoglycemia is associated with a 6- to 9-fold increase in the risk of severe hypoglycemia. Recurrent hypoglycemia, defined as the occurrence of more than one hypoglycemic event, increases the risk of severe hypoglycemia, and this also reduces hypoglycemia awareness. Before implementing strategies to help increase hypoglycemia awareness in individuals with diabetes, it is important to identify individuals who are at risk for severe hypoglycemia or have decreased hypoglycemia awareness. The risk of severe hypoglycemia is highest in individuals who have had a severe hypoglycemic episode in the past or in patients with reduced awareness of hypoglycemia. Comprehensive interventions need to be developed to increase hypoglycemia awareness in diabetic patients. While structured and comprehensive hypoglycemia awareness training is limited even for individuals with type 1 diabetes in the literature, there is no training program specifically developed for type 2 diabetes. In line with this information, it is necessary to develop a structured training program for individuals with type 2 diabetes and reduced hypoglycemia awareness and evaluate its effectiveness. Therefore, the aim of this study is to examine the effect of the hypoglycemia prevention and awareness program (HypoPAP) on patient outcomes in individuals with type 2 diabetes with decreased hypoglycemia awareness. The study was planned as a randomized controlled study."

It was developed for use in adults with diabetes (Type 1 and Type 2 using insulin). The Hypoglycemic Confidence Scale focuses on three areas: 1. Self-confidence (e.g., confidence in recognizing and managing hypoglycemia before blood sugar drops too low) 2. Confidence in avoiding hypoglycemia at critical times (e.g., while driving, exercising, and sleeping) 3. An estimate of the confidence of the spouse/partner. The Hypoglycemic Confidence Scale items are scored between 1 and 4 (1; Not at all confident 2; Somewhat confident 3; Moderately confident 4; Very confident). The ninth scale item for diabetic individuals with a spouse was interpreted as: 1; Not at all confident 2; Somewhat confident 3; Moderately confident",

          "briefSummary": "The overall goal of the Study of Women, Infant Feeding and Type 2 Diabetes after GDM pregnancy (SWIFT) is to determine the relation of longer and more intensive lactation, as compared to formula feeding, on progression to incident type 2 diabetes mellitus among women within several years following delivery of a GDM pregnancy. The initial study enrolled women with recent GDM at 6 to 9 weeks post-delivery to reclassify oral glucose tolerance and conduct subsequent testing of glucose tolerance to ascertain progression to overt diabetes up to two years later. Research methods were utilized to assess lactation intensity and duration quantitatively and to evaluate incidence rates of diabetes, as well as changes in blood glucose levels, insulin resistance, body weight, waist circumference, and overall adiposity from baseline and up to several years later. SWIFT is a prospective, observational cohort study of 1,035 women recruited during pregnancy who were diagnosed with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) via Carpenter and Coustan criteria and enrolled into the research study. We assessed the natural history of progression to prediabetes and type 2 diabetes from early postpartum for a racially and ethnically diverse cohort of women with GDM (75% minority) at high-risk for developing overt diabetes within 5-10 years post-delivery.",
          "detailedDescription": "The SWIFT study recruited women during pregnancy, and enrolled 1,035 women diagnosed with GDM who delivered a singleton, live born infant of at least 35 weeks gestation at a Kaiser Permanente Northern California hospital from 2008 to 2011, and met other study eligibility criteria. Women with recent GDM consented to three in-person research exams with the first exam at 6-9 weeks postpartum (study baseline) and the two follow up research exams continuing annually thereafter for two years post-baseline. SWIFT participants continued to be followed for clinical diagnoses of diabetes via the KPNC electronic health record system during the subsequent years through present. The study enrollment of participants began in late 2008 and ended in December 2011, and in-person follow up exams through 2014. The SWIFT cohort is racially and ethnically diverse (75% minority) with 35% Asian (1/3 South Asian, 1/3 Southeast Asian, 1/3 Chinese), 9% Black, 31% Hispanic, 23% White, and 2% mixed race/Native groups, and includes a longitudinal research Biobank, and research datasets, and clinical electronic health record data for diagnoses of diabetes and other clinical measures.\n\nEach woman provided written informed consent for three in-person exams involving administration of the 2-hour 75 gram Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) to reclassify glucose tolerance in women following GDM pregnancy, and numerous other research assessments. At baseline, 21 women were classified with overt diabetes and excluded from follow up, 2 women dropped out at baseline, and 2 women were ineligible. There were 1,010 women with recent GDM and no diabetes at baseline who were followed to evaluate the primary study outcome, the progression to glucose intolerance during the two year follow up period, defined as incident diabetes by American Diabetes Association (ADA) criteria from the 2-hour 75 gram OGTT glucose values, and/or clinical medical diagnosis of diabetes. The annual study follow up exams during the 2 years post-baseline occurred from 2009-2014. The study cohort continues in ongoing follow up for progression to diabetes and subsequent pregnancies via laboratory testing from the Kaiser Permanente electronic health records through present (72% remain KPNC health plan members). A 4th in person research exam is enrolling SWIFT participants in 2022-2024,\n\nThe primary exposure for the study is lactation intensity and duration assessed quantitatively using the method by Piper et al. 2001 to estimate a continuous lactation intensity and duration score up to 12 months postpartum. The study assessed infant feeding prospectively from prenatal telephone contacts to assess breastfeeding intention via a standardized method, inpatient hospital delivery records, participant infant feeding diaries, telephone contacts at 1 month postpartum, self-administered monthly mailed surveys (from 3 to 11 months postpartum), and from surveys at the three in-person annual study exams. Data collection during and after pregnancy was also obtained from electronic health records related to perinatal course (e.g., laboratory diagnosis of GDM phenotype severity: 3-hr OGTT z-score and GDM treatment, gestational age at GDM diagnosis, maternal pre-pregnancy BMI, gestational weight gain), medical history, prenatal measures, subsequent pregnancies, and the maternal and newborn outcomes.\n\nSubsequent studies of metabolites preceding progression to overt diabetes after gestational diabetes pregnancy are underway. Investigations are ongoing to measure changes in metabolomics, proteomics and lipidomics at the baseline and follow up exams.\n\nAt each of three study exams, trained research staff assessed maternal characteristics (infant feeding, sociodemographics, medical and reproductive history, subsequent pregnancies, medication use, recurrence of GDM, physical activity, dietary intake, depression, and sleep habits/disorders), as well as breastfeeding intensity and duration, infant health, and complementary infant dietary intake using self- and interviewer-administered questionnaires. Trained research staff measured participant anthropometry and body composition via bioelectrical impedance assessment according to standardized research protocols, as well as collected, processed, and stored biospecimens from 2-hour 75 g OGTTs (fasting and 2-h plasma and buffy coat), and administered questionnaires at each in-person exam.\n\nThe SWIFT Offspring Study, an ancillary study of mother-infant dyads, conducted three in-person exams from 6-9 weeks, 6 months and 12 months to evaluate infant ponderal growth (weight and length) during the first year of life as well as sleep, infant temperament, dietary intake, skinfold thickness, breastfeeding and formula feeding, and collect saliva specimens in the infants of the SWIFT mothers.\n\nOngoing surveillance to ascertain new diagnoses of diabetes in the SWIFT cohort occurred both during and after the study period via the KPNC electronic health records from 2009 to 2018. The SWIFT study plans to recontact all 1,033 active participants in 2019 to conduct a fourth in-person exam at 12 years post-baseline from 2022-2024 (delayed due to COVID-19 pandemic). The fourth in-person research exam at 12-years post-baseline will reassess glucose tolerance, anthropometry, body composition and other attributes as described previously. The SWIFT study also utilizes fasting plasma specimens sampled within the early postpartum period to identify metabolites for the early prediction of future progression to type 2 diabetes. Changes in anthropometry, lifestyle behaviors, and risk factors for diabetes will also be assessed at the 12-year post-baseline in-person exam."

          "briefSummary": "This study aims to test whether a multi-disciplinary intervention involving exercise and nutrition can slow down the decline in physical function, muscle strength and mass in older adults (aged 65-75) with Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity treated with Semaglutide.\n\nThe main questions it aims to answer are:\n\nIn older people with T2D and obesity, treated with Semaglutide, does a multi-disciplinary intervention of exercise and nutrition compared to standard health recommendations:\n\n1. Reduce the rate of decline in muscle mass?\n2. Reduce the rate of decline in muscle strength?\n3. Reduce the rate of decline in physical function?\n\nParticipants will:\n\nAdminister Semaglutide once weekly for 6 months. Visit the clinic once every 8 weeks for checkups and tests. Keep a diary of their exercise and food consumption. Participants in the intervention group will participate in an online exercise program and will receive personal nutritional counseling.",
          "detailedDescription": "The study will be conducted at the Center for Successful Aging with Diabetes, Sheba Medical Center and the Clinical Research Center for Diabetes, Hadassah Medical Center, Israel. The research will include a team with expertise in endocrinology, nutritional interventions, physical therapy, fitness training, medical imaging and biostatistics.\n\nParticipants aged 65-75 years, with both type 2 diabetes (T2D) and overweight / obesity, will be randomly allocated to either a (1) Semaglutide and multi-disciplinary intervention group (MDIG) comprised of exercise and diet or (2) Semaglutide and general health recommendations control group (GHRG). The drug dosage (Wegovy, Semaglutide) will be gradually increased every 4 weeks starting with 0.25 milligrams (mg) on week 0 and reaching 2.4 mg by week 16 as per the Wegovy label and maintained at 2.4 mg until the end of the trial (week 26). If a participant is unable to tolerate the 2.4 mg subcutaneous weekly dose (SC QW) of Semaglutide, the highest tolerable dose will be administered, with continued efforts to gradually increase the dose over time.\n\nParticipants in the MDIG will undergo a once-weekly group exercise training that will be delivered online, followed by 2 unsupervised home-based sessions. Weekly phone calls and a personal exercise diary will be used in order to measure adherence to the exercise program. In addition, personal nutritional counseling will be administered by a certified dietitian every 2 weeks for the first 4 weeks and every 4 weeks for the remaining 22 weeks via a virtual meeting platform (i.e., \"ZOOM\"). In addition, a 2-day food diary will be filled out for tracking and documentation. All group exercise training will be conducted via a virtual meeting platform as well. Participants allocated to the GHRG will receive general health recommendations both verbally and in writing and continue with their regular daily routine. They will also be required to complete a personal exercise and food diary.\n\nVisit 1- screening: All potential eligible subjects will be invited for a screening Visit, during which the following information would be obtained: a) Informed consent; b) Eligibility criteria form; c) Physician interview and examination; d) Demographic and medical information; e) Medical History and recent blood work.\n\nVisits 2 - 5: After being allocated to the two study arms, 4 additional measurement visits will be booked: (1) baseline - week 0 (visit 2), (2) week 8 (visit 3), (3) week 16 (visit 4), and (4) end of treatment - week 26 (visit 5). The following information will be collected on each visit: a) Anthropometric measurements, including waist and hip circumference, waist to hip ratio, weight, height and body mass index (BMI, calculated in kg/m2); b) Body composition measured with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA); c) Functional and strength assessments, including balance, aerobic capacity, gait speed and strength tests d) Blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) e) lipid profile and hemoglobin A1C test (HbA1C) (only on visits 2 and 5); f) frailty assessment (only on visits 2 and 5); g) Distribution of Semaglutide, usage and titration guidance (only visits 2-4) ; h) Documentation of 2-day self-reported food diary for MDIG (only on visits 3-5) i) Nutritional counseling for MDIG; j)collection and recording of partly used and full pens for estimation of Semaglutide adherence (only on visits 3-5); k) Documentation of exercise adherence through self-reported exercise diary (only on visits 3-5); l) Target Physical Examination; m) Adverse events collection (only on visits 3-5). All baseline measurements will be conducted within one week before the trial commences.\n\nMeasures of compliance/adherence: Compliance to the drug would be monitored in both arms. Consumption of \\<80% or \\>120% of study background medication (Semaglutide) would be considered poor adherence to therapy. Patients will be instructed to bring back all empty, partly used and full Semaglutide pens at each site visit and all pens will be counted and estimation of Semaglutide adherent will be recorded. In the MDIG, the subject's adherence to the exercise regimen will be assessed during weekly phone calls based on subject reporting and by documentation in a personal diary they will bring to each visit. Good compliance/adherence would be considered as performing ≥ 2 of the exercise sessions. In order to perform a protein consumption evaluation, the nutritional sessions will be recorded, and the patients will be asked to fill out a 2-day food diary before each visit.\n\nGlucagon-like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonist (GLP-1-RA) treatment: All patients will receive Semaglutide 2.4 mg once a week for 26 weeks. Semaglutide will start at 0.25 mg per week and escalate in a fixed-dose regimen every 4 weeks until the target dose is reached (i.e., 2.4 mg by week 16 until the end of trial). If a participant will not be able to tolerate Semaglutide 2.4 mg SC QW dose, the highest tolerable dose of Semaglutide will be used and further attempts to increase Semaglutide dose will continue.\n\nChanges in body composition will be carried out using whole-body MRI, DXA and body composition measures.\n\nFunctional assessments will include the following tests:\n\n1. Timed up and Go (TUG) test which examines dynamic balance and mobility skills. The participant is asked to get up from a chair with handles, walk three meters, turn, walk back, and sit down in the shortest possible time. Data suggests that the TUG test is a reliable and valid test for quantifying functional mobility and risk for falls that may also be useful in following clinical change over time.\n2. Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB): The SPPB is an objective assessment tool for evaluating three domains of lower extremity physical function in older adults: balance, repeated chair stands, and gait speed. It is associated with various adverse health outcomes in older adults, including mobility impairments, difficulties performing basic activities of daily living (ADL) or instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), and falls. Poor performance on the SPPB and its components independently predict higher fall risk over 1 and 4 years of follow-up.\n3. The 6-minute walk test (6MWT). The 6MWT assesses aerobic capacity. The test measures the distance walked over six minutes on a hard, flat surface. The goal is for the individual to walk as far as possible in six minutes. The 6MWT has been linked to frailty and mortality in older adults.\n\n4.10-meter walk (10MW): The 10MW determines gait speed. The participant is asked to walk at a \"comfortable pace\" for 14 meters. The score achieved is determined by the walking time of the central 10 meters. Studies have shown that better gait speed is associated with a lower risk for functional decline, hospitalization and mortality.\n\nStrength tests:\n\n1. 30 second chair stand (STS): The purpose of this test is to evaluate lower limb muscle strength. The instructions are to get up from sitting to standing as many times as possible without the assistance of the arms for 30 seconds. The number of times within 30 seconds that the participant succeeds to rise from a seated position is counted. The strength of the lower limb muscles has a crucial impact on daily function. Failure to perform STS movements efficiently and smoothly may lead to falls.\n2. Hand grip strength test: The maximum grip strength test evaluates upper limb strength using the Jamar dynamometer. The test is conducted in a neutral hand position and repeated 3 times. Grip strength assessment has been shown to have predictive validity and low values are associated with falls, disability, impaired health-related quality of life and prolonged length of stay in hospital as well as increased mortality.\n\nScreening for frailty will be performed using the Fried scale. The scale includes five criteria, and pre-frailty is defined as the presence of two components while frailty is defined as the presence of at least three of the following components: (1) unintentional weight loss - loss of 10 lbs/4.5 kg or more in 1 year; (2) self-reported exhaustion / fatigue; (3) low physical activity level as assessed by a modified Baecke questionnaire; (4) slow gait speed - less than 0.8 m/s with or without a walking aid; (5) low grip strength relative to gender and body weight.\n\nAnthropometric measurements: Weight and height, with body mass index (BMI) calculated as kg/m2 and waist and hip circumference measured, and waist to hip ratio calculated.\n\nGlycemic control (GC): Hba1c will be collected at baseline and at the end of trial.\n\nSocio-demographic questionnaire: Socio-demographic characteristics, including age, gender, education, marital status, employment status, ethnicity, and smoking status, will be collected at visit 1.\n\nDiscontinuation: Participants may withdraw consent for any reason at any time or be discontinued from the trial by the investigator if, based upon his clinical judgment, continuation in the trial is deemed inappropriate. In addition, the investigator may discontinue a subject if enrollment into the trial is inappropriate, the trial plan is violated, or for administrative and/or any other safety reasons or if the trial is terminated early for any reason."

The trial includes a 2-year intervention period followed by 3 years of follow-up. The primary objective is to investigate whether daily dietary supplementation with vitamin D3 (1600 IU) or yeast β-glucan (600 mg) reduces the risk of major cardiovascular diseases, including myocardial infarction, stroke, treated or hospitalized heart failure, and cardiovascular deaths. The secondary objectives include evaluating the effects of vitamin D3 or yeast β-glucan supplementation on all-cause mortality, microvascular disease, cognitive function, and other outcomes.",
          "detailedDescription": "The goal of this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, with a 2×2 factorial design in individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D), is to investigate the effects of vitamin D or yeast β-glucan supplementation on major cardiovascular diseases. Approximately 8,000 subjects aged 40-79 with T2D will be included in this study. Eligible participants will be randomly assigned to one of four groups: (1) daily vitamin D3 (1600 IU) and yeast β-glucan (600 mg); (2) daily vitamin D3 (1600 IU) and placebo for yeast β-glucan (600 mg); (3) daily placebo for vitamin D3 (1600 IU) and yeast β-glucan (600 mg); or (4) daily placebo for vitamin D3 (1600 IU) and placebo for yeast β-glucan (600 mg).\n\nAt baseline, questionnaires will be administered to collect data on sociodemographic factors, lifestyle habits, health status, cognitive function, and medical conditions, et al. Participants will also undergo physical measurements, and blood, urine, and feces samples will be collected at study centers.\n\nThe study includes a 2-year intervention period followed by a 3-year follow-up. Participants in all groups will take four capsules daily for 2 years: two capsules containing either vitamin D or its placebo and two capsules containing either yeast β-glucan or its placebo. On-site follow-ups, including questionnaires, physical measurements, and sample collection, will be conducted at 6, 12, 24 and 60 months.\n\nThis study will also evaluate the effects on all-cause mortality, microvascular complications, cognitive function, and other outcomes, providing scientific evidence for the health effects of vitamin D or yeast β-glucan in individuals with type 2 diabetes."

          "briefSummary": "This study is a continuation of a previously approved protocol conducted at Ohio State University and Indiana University. The first two aims of the original protocol have been completed, and this protocol will finish enrollment for the third aim, comparing Hi TEWL and Low TEWL measurements, and whether a HiTEWLmeasurement indicates a seemingly healed wound is more likely to recur/reopen toa new wound.\n\nOf the 105 desired subjects, 62 subjects have already been recruited and completed their study participation at the previous university. 43 additional subjects will be recruited to complete the enrollment goal here at the University of Pittsburgh.",
          "detailedDescription": "In the United States, chronic wounds represent a major public health burden. Estimates put the number of chronic wounds cases at over 6.5 million with a cost burden of over $50 billion14. According to the current standard of care (SoC), wound closure is assessed visually. The FDA defines complete wound closure of chronic non-healing wounds as \"skin closure (as assessed visually) without drainage or dressing requirements identified at two consecutive study visits that are 2 weeks apart\" and requires therapeutic trials for chronic wounds to be designed such that the enrolled patients will be evaluated for at least 3 months following completeclosure19.\n\nThe expectation is that successful intervention should keep the wound closed for at least 90 days. This study contends that visual inspection of wounds is insufficient to certify closure - a critical endpoint that drives treatment decisions. Considering that almost two-thirds of all chronic wounds are estimated to be biofilminfected6, and the observation that biofilm-infected wounds may be visually closed but functionally (barrier function) open, the significance of the proposed hypothesis is substantial.\n\nThe proposed study has the clear potential to lay a strong rationale that would potentially change the wound care paradigm by requiring that measurement of skin barrier function be the new endpoint to define wound closure. Reported recurrence rates for most chronic ulcer types remain extremely high, ranging from 40-79%4,5, 24%-57% for venous ulcers, and upward of 60% for diabetic ulcers supporting the importance of preventive efforts1,2. In that context it is of extraordinary significance to ask whether \"defective closure\" (visually closed with TEWL (Trans-Epidermal Water Loss) \\>3x the value of intact skin; high TEWL) predicts poor post-closure outcome e.g. recurrence. These questions may only be meaningfully asked in a patient-based pilot and that is exactly the intent of Aim 2. Findings of the proposed pilot will inform a larger future trial."

During the first week, the device will be set to \"blinded mode,\" meaning participants cannot see their glucose readings. During the second week, the device will be switched to \"unblinded mode,\" allowing participants to view their glucose levels and trends in real-time.\n\nThe study aims to determine if simply seeing real-time glucose data can help patients improve their blood sugar control (such as increasing the time their blood sugar is in the target range) without receiving additional structured education on diet or exercise. Researchers will compare the glucose data collected during the blinded week with the data from the unblinded week."

Sarcopenia in this proposal is defined by impaired metabolism and physical function associated with decreased skeletal muscle mass or function. Skeletal muscle tissue relies on mitochondria to efficiently utilize oxygen to generate ATP. Impaired mitochondrial energetics is a central mechanism of sarcopenia in CKD. The investigators propose a series of studies designed to shed light on the pathophysiology of sarcopenia in persons with CKD not treated with dialysis. Investigators will conduct a randomized-controlled intervention trial of combined resistance training and aerobic exercise vs. health education to assess changes in skeletal muscle mitochondrial function, metabolism and physical function. Investigators hypothesize that exercise improves mitochondrial function and physical function in persons with CKD. If successful, these experiments will identify novel pathophysiologic mechanisms for CKD-associated sarcopenia.

Sarcopenia is defined by decreased muscle mass or function and is central to the frailty phenotype that is associated disability, hospitalization, and death. Sarcopenia is a common and devastating complication of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The investigators and others have demonstrated a high prevalence of physical frailty among CKD patients not treated with dialysis. Furthermore the investigators have demonstrated greater than 30% impairment in lower extremity physical performance measures in persons with CKD compared with predicted values. The aging demographic among CKD patients will result in a substantial U.S. public health burden attributable to sarcopenia. In the year 2000, direct healthcare costs attributable to sarcopenia in the U.S. were18.5 billion.\n\nSarcopenia is associated with adverse health-related outcomes. Sarcopenia in older adults is consistently linked with decreased physical functioning, disability, falls, hospitalization, and mortality. Impaired lower extremity physical performance, as measured by objective testing, is associated with all-cause mortality in CKD patients not treated with dialysis and that these associations are stronger in magnitude than those for traditional risk factors. Skeletal muscle is major site of peripheral glucose utilization ameliorating oxidative stress and endothelial injury associated with acute post-prandial hyperglycemia. Through these mechanisms sarcopenia may contribute to metabolic disturbances of insulin resistance, oxidative stress, and endothelial dysfunction leading to cardiovascular disease.\n\nMitochondrial dysfunction is central to skeletal muscle dysfunction. Skeletal muscle mitochondria are necessary for the efficient generation of energy (ATP) from oxygen and normal lipid metabolism. Under normal conditions, muscle efficiently utilizes the majority of supplied oxygen such that only 0.2% of mitochondrial oxygen is shuttled into reactive oxidative species (ROS). Under pathologic situations there is uncoupling of oxygen consumption and ATP generation resulting in increased oxygen consumption and decreased ATP production in a process leading to increased ROS and oxidative stress. Uncoupling of oxygen and ATP generation directly affects skeletal muscle function. Decreased efficiency of ATP generation has been linked to decreased muscle strength and more recently associated with decreased gait speed in older adults.\n\nMagnetic resonance spectroscopy and optical spectroscopy (MRS/OS) provide novel, non-invasive and real-time insight into human skeletal muscle mitochondrial function. MRS/OS is a novel technique that measures maximal mitochondrial ATP production in-vivo following acute bouts of ischemia induced by exercise using phosphorous MRS (31P MRS). The rate of recovery of phosphocreatinine after cessation of exercise is used to characterize the rate of aerobic mitochondrial ATP resynthesis above that of basal anaerobic glycolytic ATP production. By combining this technique with optical spectroscopy post-exercise measuring the transport of oxygen from hemoglobin to myoglobin within the muscle the investigators are able to accurately determine the ratio of coupling efficiency between of ATP generation per unit of oxygen consumption. Skeletal muscle mitochondrial dysfunction measured by ATP generating capacity and coupling efficiency has been associated with processes of aging and insulin resistance. Furthermore studies in healthy subjects have shown that muscle performance and fatigue are linked to the ability to resynthesize ATP rather than lactate concentration.\n\nPreliminary MRS/OS findings suggest profoundly altered mitochondrial function in CKD patients. Previous experimental studies suggest that uremia in dialysis patients affects skeletal muscle structure and mitochondrial function. Oxidative damage is highly prevalent in CKD, evidenced by increased biomarkers of oxidative stress and changes in glutathione, an important antioxidant. Prior small studies in non-diabetic CKD patients suggest impairment of ex-vivo mitochondrial function by reductions in mitochondrial enzyme activity. Based on these findings investigators used novel, non-invasive, functional MRS/OS assay to characterize in-vivo mitochondrial function. Preliminary findings in non-diabetic CKD patients indicate markedly reduced ATP to oxygen ratio compared to controls. This finding suggests altered mitochondrial energetics as a candidate central mechanism linking metabolic derangements and impaired physical function in CKD, and motivate the hypothesis that mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with oxidative stress, insulin resistance and impaired physical functioning in CKD.\n\nExercise may ameliorate mitochondrial dysfunction, insulin resistance and physical functioning in CKD. Studies of exercise in non-CKD patients with diabetes and insulin resistance have demonstrated exercise-induced improvements in mitochondrial biogenesis linked to improved insulin sensitivity as well as decreased mitochondrial oxidative stress. Animal studies suggest that exercise stimulates autophagy resulting in removal of defective and inefficient mitochondrial leading to a healthy mitochondrial network and improved insulin sensitivity.The primary goal of this study is to investigate the impact of combined resistance and aerobic exercise on skeletal muscle dysfunction. Given the investigator's preliminary data demonstrating strong association of sarcopenia and mortality in CKD, effective interventions that can impact physical function are urgently needed to improve patient health outcomes."

          "briefSummary": "The project, called Food for Health (F4H), will study a new Produce Prescription Program (PPP) designed for rural Native American older adults. The study is based in the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes (CSKT) of the Flathead Indian Reservation in Montana. In this community, many older adults face food insecurity and higher risk for Type 2 Diabetes (T2D). The tribal health department (THD) and local Food Resource Center (FRC) already provide important health and food support services, and this project builds on these strengths.\n\nProduce Prescription Programs (PPPs) is a type of nutrition support intervention that connects healthcare providers with local food programs to help patients access fresh, healthy foods. For example, an individual enrolled in the study will be \"prescribe\" fruits and vegetables in the form of a vouchers or coupons, which can be used to buy these foods at local food centers. Research shows that this type of program can reduce food insecurity, improve diet, and support better health. PPPs also fit well with tribal community priorities by supporting food sovereignty, culture-based nutrition education, and a stronger local food system.\n\nA key part of the study approach is using Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR). CBPR means that community members, health providers, and researchers work together as equal partners. This way, the program is not just designed \"for\" the community, but \"with\" the community. The CSKT THD and community members have been involved in shaping this project from the start, and their priorities-like food security and food sovereignty-are at the center of the work.\n\nThe investigators will carry out the study in two phases.\n\nPhase 1: Investigators will pilot test the acceptability of F4H in a small group of older adults (N=10) to understand the program's acceptability. The results will be used to refine and improve the program before moving to the next phase.\n\nPhase 2: Investigators will test the feasibility and impact of the refined F4H program with a larger group of older adults (N=33). Participant food insecurity and T2D risk factors, such as blood sugar and weight, will be measured before and after the program. Investigators expect that participants will have less food insecurity and healthier measures after completing the program.\n\nThe clinic-to-community model is central to F4H. The THD will provide the prescriptions, and the FRC will be where participants redeem vouchers for fruits, vegetables, and other nutritious foods. The program will also include nutrition education that is grounded in Native culture and values. This model helps strengthen connections between healthcare and community services, creating a more supportive system for older adults.\n\nIn addition to testing the program, investigators will study how it is carried out. This is called implementation research. It means paying attention to how the program fits into the community setting, what helps it succeed, and what barriers might need to be addressed. Understanding these factors is important so that the program can continue in the future and potentially be expanded to other Native communities.\n\nThe long-term goal of F4H is to empower Native American communities to improve nutrition and reduce health disparities. By supporting older adults in gaining better access to healthy foods, the aim is to lower diabetes risk, improve quality of life, and strengthen local food systems. If the program is successful, it can serve as a model for other rural communities facing similar challenges.",
          "detailedDescription": "Study Design - Food for Health (F4H)\n\nType 2 diabetes (T2D) and food insecurity disproportionately affect Native American (NA) populations. These inequities are closely tied to the social determinants of health (SDOH), including limited access to affordable, nutritious foods. Food insecurity among NAs is approximately 20% higher than among non-Hispanic Whites, reflecting structural inequities rooted in the long-term impacts of colonization, forced relocation, and the disruption of traditional food systems. In response, many tribal communities are prioritizing food sovereignty, food security, and culturally relevant health interventions to address these disparities.\n\nProduce Prescription Programs (PPPs) represent an evidence-based intervention (EBI) that directly addresses food insecurity by linking higher risk patients with access to healthy foods. Through provider-issued prescriptions, patients receive vouchers redeemable at local food outlets for fruits, vegetables, and other nutritious items. PPPs reduce barriers to healthy eating, improve diet quality, and demonstrate promise in reducing risk for chronic disease. Importantly, PPPs align well with NA community priorities to strengthen local food systems and advance culture-centered nutrition education. However, little research has examined PPP effectiveness among rural NA older adults, a critical gap given their elevated risk for T2D and underrepresentation in nutrition and implementation research.\n\nThe Food for Health (F4H) intervention aims to fill this gap. F4H is a clinic-to-community PPP designed for rural NA older adults and co-developed with the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes (CSKT) of the Flathead Indian Reservation in Montana. The intervention will connect the tribal health department (THD) with a local Food Resource Center (FRC) to enhance access to fresh produce and strengthen community-based nutrition supports. A unique feature of this study is its community-based participatory research (CBPR) framework, which ensures that the intervention is designed, implemented, and evaluated in collaboration with community partners and responsive to tribal priorities such as food security and sovereignty.\n\nThe study will be conducted in two phases.\n\nPhase 1 (Aim 1): Assess the acceptability of F4H and identify implementation determinants. Ten older adult participants (N=10) will engage in the intervention, and ten key informants (N=10) from the THD and FRC will participate in interviews. Data will provide insight into participant experiences, cultural appropriateness, and organizational readiness. Results will refine the intervention protocol and implementation plan to ensure alignment with community needs and context.\n\nPhase 2 (Aim 2): Evaluate the feasibility, implementation strategies, and preliminary effectiveness of the refined F4H intervention in a larger sample of rural NA older adults (N=33). Key outcomes include changes in food insecurity and T2D risk factors (e.g., weight, blood glucose) measured pre- and post-intervention. Investigators hypothesize that participants will experience reduced food insecurity and improved T2D risk indicators immediately following the intervention.\n\nThe F4H model will be studied using implementation research methods, which prioritize understanding how EBIs can be integrated into real-world public health practice. This includes assessing contextual facilitators and barriers, stakeholder engagement, and sustainability potential. By embedding F4H in existing community and healthcare infrastructure, the project builds capacity for long-term impact and scalability within NA communities.\n\nThe long-term goal of this research is to empower rural NA communities to strengthen food systems, enhance access to healthy foods, and reduce the disproportionate burden of T2D among older adults. By combining evidence-based intervention strategies with a CBPR framework, this study addresses a significant gap in nutrition and implementation research and provides a foundation for larger-scale trials. If effective, F4H has the potential to serve as a scalable model for addressing food insecurity and chronic disease prevention in tribal communities nationwide."

The investigators will do this by measuring factors in the blood, such as sugars, fats, metabolites, and proteins, after eating a standardized breakfast meal at the first visit and after taking 14 doses of oral semaglutide over two weeks before the second study visit. The food (mixed meal breakfast) we will be studying is specially prepared to contain a set amount of protein, carbohydrates, and fat. The investigators hypothesize that understanding how the acute biochemical response to oral semaglutide differs by genetic variation will generate insight into drug mechanisms and type 2 diabetes pathophysiology.",
          "detailedDescription": "On day 1 (Visit 1), the research subject will present to the Translational and Clinical Research Center (TCRC) after an overnight fast. We will obtain informed consent, check vital signs, take anthropometric measurements, and draw fasting blood work through an intravenous catheter. The subject will then be provided a standard mixed meal to be consumed within 30 minutes. Additional blood will be drawn at the time of meal completion (0 minutes), as well as 5, 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes following the meal. During study days 3-15, the subject will take 7 mg of oral semaglutide once daily. On day 16 (Visit 2), the research subject will return to the TCRC. During this visit, the subject will take the final (14th) dose of semaglutide, receive fasting blood work, and receive another mixed meal with subsequent blood draws at several time points over 120 minutes."

Hypothesis: Having access to a dietitian can better laboratory values and affect dietary intake, nutritional status, QoL and HL in a positive matter.\n\nMethod:\n\nPilot cluster RCT study in the dialysis units in Holbæk and Slagelse in Region Zealand, Denmark. Clustering of people on dialysis the same day to either intervention or control group. The groups is expected to be similar regarding clinical characteristics. A pilot project will be conducted in 2024 in the dialysis units in Slagelse and Holbæk.\n\nData collection:\n\nBoth groups:\n\n* Patient characteristics (at the beginning of project): Age and gender, height, medical diagnosis, socioeconomic data (income, job, education, partner status) and dialysis vintage.\n* Clinical Data (before and after the intervention, and at 6 and 12 month after the intervention period): Biochemical values (phosphate, potassium, urea, albumin, PTH), anthropometric measures (dry weight, actual weight), medication, ultrafiltration, and number of contacts with dietitian.\n* Questionnaires and tests (collected before and after the intervention): Body composition (fat, fat-free mass, water), Nutritional status, Intake (HeartDiet Questionnaire), Quality of Life (KDQOL-SF), Health Literacy (HLQ), and previous dietary treatment.\n\nPrimary outcome: Change in average p-phosphate Secondary outcomes: Change in average p-potassium, number of phosphate binders, number of potassium binders, HeartDiet-score, Nutritional Status (nutritional screening), Adherence to diet (End Stage Renal Disease Adherence Questionnaire, ESRD-AQ-score), Quality of life (Kidney Disease Quality of Life Short Form, KDQOL-SF-score) and Health literacy (Health Literacy Questionnaire, HLQ-score)\n\nIntervention:\n\nThe intervention group receives an initial individual dietary interview, monthly follow-up and weekly access to a dietitian in the dialysis unit for four months.\n\nThe individualized dietary treatment based on the patient's preferences and needs according to the Nutrition Care Process. It is carried out according to the practical guidelines from the Danish Dietetic Association on dietary treatment of chronic kidney disease. The dietary treatment uses a dialogic and person-centered approach The intervention is described in the protocol using the TIDieR framework. The control group receives usual care with referral to a dietitian when needed.\n\nStatistics:\n\nThe average phosphorus level and standard deviation after a diet intervention was 1.58 ± 0.32 mmol/l, therefore using 0.32 mmol/l in calculation of sample size. An implementation of guidelines and a systematic review showed a difference in phosphosus levels between intervention and control group of 0.23 and 0.30 mmol/l respectively.\n\nCalculation of sample size using \"Sample Size Calculator (clincalc.com)\". Using the values mentioned above, a power of 80% and a significance of 5% shows a sample size of 18-30 people in each group to show a significant change in phosphorus levels.\n\nComparison of changes in average values using unpaired t-test, including endpoints of p-phosphorous and p-potassium, QoL-score and health literacy score. For dichotomous endpoints such as nutritional score, comparison of the percentage of the groups within and without specific limits. Data analysis with intention-to-treat and statistical calculations by a person not familiar with the groups."

          "briefSummary": "This randomized controlled trial evaluated the efficacy of once-weekly trelagliptin compared to once-daily vildagliptin in reducing HbA1c levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). A total of 102 participants, aged 30-60 years with HbA1c levels between 7.5% and 9.5%, were enrolled and randomly assigned to either the trelagliptin or vildagliptin group. The primary outcome measured was the percentage of participants achieving an HbA1c level of less than 7% after three months of treatment. Secondary outcomes included the mean reduction in HbA1c levels from baseline. The study aimed to determine whether trelagliptin, with its once-weekly dosing regimen, could improve medication adherence and glycemic control compared to the conventional daily administration of vildagliptin. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 26.0, with independent t-tests and chi-square tests employed for statistical comparisons. Findings from this study contributed to the understanding of the clinical effectiveness of weekly versus daily DPP-4 inhibitors in the management of T2DM.",
          "detailedDescription": "Before the commencement of the study, ethical approval was obtained from the Institutional Review Board of the hospital. All study procedures adhered strictly to the ethical guidelines of both institutions, ensuring the confidentiality and privacy of all participant data. Potential study participants were provided with detailed information about the study protocols, including the objectives, procedures, potential risks, and benefits of participation. Informed consent was obtained from all participants who met the inclusion criteria and agreed to participate after fully understanding the study details. Participants were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes according to standard diagnostic criteria as per the operational definition. A detailed history was taken to gather basic demographic and clinical data such as age, gender, and comorbidities. Baseline laboratory investigations, including liver function tests (LFTs), renal function tests (RFTs), serum electrolytes, and fundoscopy, were conducted to ensure participants met the selection criteria.\n\nEligible participants were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups (Group A or Group B) using a lottery method to ensure equal and unbiased distribution.\n\nGroup A received trelagliptin 100 mg once weekly before breakfast on the same day of the week. Group B received vildagliptin 50 mg once daily. Both groups followed the prescribed treatment regimen for a duration of three months. Participants were followed up at three months of treatment. Outcome assessments included monitoring the mean reduction in HbA1c levels and evaluating the efficacy of the treatment, aiming for an HbA1c level of less than 7% after three months of treatment. Data were collected using a data collection proforma."

          "briefSummary": "MTX228 has been identified as a medication that might allow the re-growth of insulin producing beta cells in people with Type 1 Diabetes. Promoting the re-growth of lost beta cells would be beneficial to people with Type 1 Diabetes because it would allow them to take less insulin by injection and would improve their overall blood sugar control while reducing the risk and rate of low blood sugars. This open-label dose selection study aims to determine the optimal dose ofMTX228 for use in a future phase IIb study.\n\nThe purpose is to investigate the relative effectiveness of different doses of MTX228 and to select the most effective dose for further investigation in a phase 2b study.",
          "detailedDescription": "MTX228 was developed as a treatment for gastric ulcers but did not advance beyond phase 2 clinical trials because of lack of efficacy. Subsequently, MTX228 has been identified as an activator of Lyn kinase and was considered as a treatment for type 2 diabetes as an insulin sensitizer because of Lyn's interaction with insulin signaling molecules. More recently, Lyn has been identified as a critical regulator of beta-cell mass, with genetic and biochemical inactivation of Lyn provoking beta-cell death in isolated human islets and precipitated diabetes in mice, and activation of Lyn stimulating beta-cell survival and beta-cell proliferation. These findings strongly suggest that small molecule activators of Lyn, such as MTX228, could represent new therapeutic options to promote beta-cell regeneration in type 1 diabetes.\n\nMTX228 has not been testing in clinical studies in type 1 diabetes and the optimal dose to use is not clear from the clinical trial in type 2 diabetes, where lower doses (100 mg once or twice daily) were more effective than higher doses (200 mg once or twice daily). The purpose of this study is to compare the effect of different doses of MTX228 in order to determine the most effective dose to move forward in a subsequent phase 2b study."

Five EUROASPIRE surveys have been carried out by the European Society of Cardiology so far: EUROASPIRE I in 1995-1997 in nine countries, EUROASPIRE II in 1999- 2000 in 15 countries, EUROASPIRE III in 2006-2009 in 22 countries, EUROASPIRE IV in 2012-2015 in 26 countries and EUROASPIRE V in 2016-2018 in 27 countries.\n\nThis sixth EUROASPIRE survey will investigate the cardiometabolic and renal continuum in both secondary and primary cardiovascular disease prevention in 2023-2025 under the auspices of the European Society of Cardiology, Global Registries And Surveys Programme (GRASP). As in the previous EUROASPIRE surveys this survey will be focused on hospital patients with CHD, with and without diabetes mellitus, and apparently healthy individuals in primary care at high risk (hypertension, dyslipidaemia, diabetes) of developing CVD."

          "briefSummary": "Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) is associated with prolonged hospitalization and an increased risk of readmission. Moreover, sedentary behavior and poor glycemic control may contribute to disease severity and mortality. The inactivity during hospitalization is particularly concerning in T2D patients, due to the negative effect on glucose metabolism and secondary loss of skeletal muscle mass, which can further disrupt glucose regulation. However, there are no exercise guidelines for hospitalized T2D patients. To address this gap, a feasibility study will be conducted examining the effectiveness of incorporating resistance training into hospital care for T2D patients. For the feasibility study, 24 patients with T2D or prediabetes will be recruited from the Department of Infectious Diseases at Rigshospitalet and Hvidovre Hospital and randomized to 4 weeks of resistance training for 30 minutes per day or standard treatment. If the participants are discharged they will be offered online-training sessions. During the hospitalization a continuous glucose monitor will be applied and an accelerometer during the full intervention. At baseline, discharge and at follow-up, extensive testing will be performed.",
          "detailedDescription": "Patients will be invited to participate, preferably within the first 24 hours of admission, and randomized to either resistance-based bodyweight exercise or a control group. In total, 24 patients will be recruited, and distributed between the groups stratified for biological sex. At baseline, participants will have their medical history, social anamnesis, height, and weight assessed. At baseline a continuous glucose monitor will and accelerometer will be applied, to be worn until discharge and end of the intervention, respectively. Furthermore at baseline a multitude of questionnaires will be performed: International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), Strength, Assistance in walking, Rise from a chair, Climb stairs, and Falls (SARC-F), Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire (BIPQ), 5-level EQ-5D version (EQ-5D-5L), WHO-5 Well-Being Index (WHO-5).\n\nIntervention session A body-weight based resistance exercise program will be performed based on a booklet \"Syg men sund og aktiv\" Sick but healthy and active for 30 minutes per day. Described in more detail below.\n\nControl session The control group will be placed in a seated position for 30 minutes corresponding to the time the intervention group is active.\n\nAssessments before and after intervention/control sessions Before the sessions the EQ-5D-5L, the WHO-5 modified to a daily version, and an acute assessment of malaise, tiredness, nausea, dizziness, pain and breathlessness will be performed using numerical rating scales (NRS). After the session the NRS will be performed again.\n\nFollow-up visit Two days after completion of the intervention, the participants will be invited for a follow-up visit at the Centre for Physical Activity Research, Rigshospitalet. This visit includes a qualitative interview, assessment of body composition, assessment of physical capabilities, ultrasound of the thigh, and blood samples. In case the patient is unable to attend the follow-up visit at the center, the daily operating manager will visit the patient at home. In this case, Ultrasound and muscle biopsy will not be performed. If the patient lives more than one hour away by car, the assessment will be performed online and will not include ultrasound, body composition and blood tests."

The training program will be the same. The intervention group will ideally exercise post-prandially (within 60 min following the meal) following either breakfast or lunch. Exercise intensity will be monitored throughout the training (with a heart rate monitor) and patients will estimate the rigorousness of the training using the rate of perceived exertion (RPE)-scale. If possible, the goal is for the patients to reach a minimum of 5, corresponding to moderate intensity, but preferably 7+ on the 0-10 RPE scale in each set.

If they fulfill the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria, they will be, after signing informed consent, randomized to a six-month intervention with either pioglitazone, empagliflozin or semaglutide. Fat biopsies are obtained from the subcutaneous abdominal area before and after a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp at baseline and after six months. Participants are regularly followed during this the intervention. The overall goal is to determine how antidiabetic-drugs affect white adipose tissue cellularity and whether adipose heterogeneity impacts on drug response. The primary outcome measure is the change in fat tissue lipolysis (glycerol release in isolated fat cells after hormone stimulation) before and after treatment.",

Mentoring local clinics to initiate this intervention is a promising strategy to enhance sustainable diabetes care and reduce disparities in vulnerable minority populations.",
          "detailedDescription": "Diabetes is a major public health problem in Latino(a)s. There are escalating numbers of Latino(a)s diagnosed with diabetes and at disproportionate rates compared to other ethnicities. Numerous interventions have been initiated to improve minority healthcare including diabetes group visits, which have been valuable in improving education and glycemic control. In our group visit investigations, investigators initiated Community Health Workers (CHWs)-local community members who serve as culturally-sensitive patient liaisons to the healthcare system-as part of the multidisciplinary team. Investigators demonstrated that CHWs are vital team members and particularly helpful in identifying medication-access barriers. However, CHWs are frontline workers and often left unsupported and poorly supervised. Investigators used these data to pioneer the combination of four diabetes interventions. This trial showed that individuals randomized to the intervention significantly improved glycemic control, blood pressure and adherence to American Diabetes Association standards compared to usual care. The study also showed that telehealth (mobile health (mHealth) and ZOOM video conferencing) was instrumental in supporting CHWs in their work and enhancing their communication with patients.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the expansive use of telehealth and its ability to improve healthcare. It has also underscored the pressing need to improve care for low-income minorities. Though diabetes programs are valuable in improving education and clinical outcomes, they are often difficult to initiate in low-income settings. Pragmatic implementation using telehealth to mentor local clinic teams of providers and CHWs is promising to address these barriers. Investigators have pilot data showing the feasibility of telementoring a local clinic to initiate our program that has resulted in improved HbA1c levels but it needs to be tested within a larger sample. In the proposed study investigators will evaluate this approach in a randomized clinical trial (N=320; intervention=160) of low-income, adult Latino(a)s with type 2 diabetes randomized to the diabetes program intervention versus usual care (UC). Our research group will provide telementoring to local clinic teams to initiate our program into their clinics. To evaluate efficacy, investigators will compare the intervention versus UC clinical changes including HbA1c (primary outcome), blood pressure, cholesterol, and body mass index from baseline to 12-months (AIM 1). To compare longitudinal data of study arms, investigators will follow these clinical measures until 36 months (AIM 2). Investigators will also provide program acceptability and evaluation data for participants and clinic teams from baseline to 12-months (AIM 3). Investigators hypothesize that intervention participants will have superior and more sustainable clinical outcomes compared to UC individuals and that the intervention will have high levels of acceptability and evaluation data. Investigators anticipate that the proposed study will provide justification of telementoring to initiate the intervention and strong evidence to improve the longitudinal care of low-income Latino(a)s with diabetes."

Blood tests will be performed to check how much LY4057996 gets into the bloodstream and how long it takes the body to eliminate it.\n\nThe study will last 11 weeks for Part A1-A2, 4 weeks for A3-A5, 6 weeks for Part B and 7 weeks for Part C, all approximations, excluding a screening period."

          "briefSummary": "This clinical trial aims to compare a continuous glucose monitoring system with traditional fingerstick blood glucose monitoring. The study focuses on adult patients in general surgical wards who need regular blood glucose checks due to the risk of low or high blood sugar levels.\n\nThe goal is to learn if using a continuous glucose monitoring system is better than fingerstick monitoring in managing glucose levels, preventing complications, improving patient satisfaction and experience, reducing nursing staff workload, and improving nursing staff' experience. The study also compares the accuracy of glucose readings from the continuous glucose monitoring system with those from fingerstick tests and blood samples.\n\nThe hypothesis is that CGMS is accurate and effective for monitoring glucose levels in surgical patients. This could lead to better blood sugar control, fewer complications, shorter hospital stays, and improved experiences for both patients and nursing staff.",
          "detailedDescription": "Glucose control in surgical patients at risk of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia is essential, as these conditions can lead to infections, poor surgical outcomes, prolonged hospital stays, and death. In 2022, the prevalence of diagnosed diabetes in Denmark was 6.2%. With the global incidence of diabetes on the rise, the number of patients requiring glucose control during surgical admissions is increasing.\n\nPoint-of-care (POC) fingerstick capillary glucose monitoring (FSGM) is standard in many hospitals; however, FSGM can be painful, disrupt sleep, and increase postoperative stress for patients. Additionally, it can be time-consuming, requiring up to two hours of nursing work per patient daily. This makes timely and prescribed glucose monitoring challenging in busy surgical wards, potentially leading to untreated hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia. Moreover, FSGM provides only a snapshot of glucose levels, without indicating whether glucose is stable, rising, or falling.\n\nAn alternative to FSGM is continuous glucose monitoring systems (CGMS), which measure glucose levels via a subcutaneous sensor every few minutes. CGMS is predominantly used in ambulatory settings and has been shown to improve glucose regulation. Several studies have confirmed the accuracy of CGMS compared to FSGM in surgical and medical wards, reporting an overall mean absolute relative difference ranging from 9.4 to 12.9, making it acceptable for use in surgical wards. Other studies have reported that CGMS in surgical and medical wards results in superior glycemic control, reduced hypoglycemia, insulin usage, and in-hospital complications, and detected significant duration of both hypo- and hyperglycemia despite protocolized perioperative diabetes management compared to FSGM.\n\nStudies on patients' perspectives of CGMS have been limited to everyday life and outpatient settings. One review on patients with type 1 and 2 diabetes experienced improved convenience, control, and freedom by the use of CGMS but were also overwhelmed by data and frustrated by inaccuracy, and technical issues, which is consistent with findings from another review of patients with diabetes type 2. Another study reported that patients with type 2 diabetes found the technology helpful for disease management, although it could also serve as an unpleasant reminder of disease progression and cause discomfort.\n\nOne case report has described nurses' experiences with CGMS in hospital wards for patients with type 1 diabetes. The nurses experienced an increased workload due to difficulties hearing the device receiver, leading to more frequent patient observations.\n\nIn summary, CGMS has been reported to be safe and beneficial in ambulatory settings, while challenges and knowledge gaps remain in hospital wards. To date, no studies have compared glucose levels from CGMS with those from a laboratory plasma glucose analyzer as the reference. This study aims to investigate the effect of CGMS compared to FSGM in patients with hyperglycemia in general surgical wards on glucose levels, complications, length of hospital stay, and patient satisfaction and experience with glucose management during hospitalization and up to three months after discharge. Additionally, the study will investigate the nursing staff's workload and experience in the surgical ward, and the accuracy of CGMS throughout hospitalization, including during surgical procedures and medical imaging.\n\nSeven substudies will be conducted:\n\nSubstudy 1 - Glucose levels and management for surgical patients in relation to hospitalization: Compares point-of-care glucose levels and management using point-of-care FSGM and point-of-care CGMS during hospitalization and FSGM and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) up to three months after discharge.\n\nSubstudy 2 - Patient satisfaction with glucose monitoring and management in surgical wards: Compares patient satisfaction with glucose monitoring and management for surgical patients using point-of-care FSGM and point-of-care CGMS during hospitalization.\n\nSubstudy 3 - Nursing staff's glucose monitoring and management workload in the surgical ward: Compares the nursing staff's workload with point-of-care FSGM to point-of-care CGMS for surgical patients.\n\nSubstudy 4 (qualitative study) - Patient experience of glucose monitoring and management in relation to hospitalization in surgical wards: Compares the patient experience with point-of-care FSGM to point-of-care CGMS and glucose management during hospitalization in the surgical ward and one compares the patient experience of FSGM with CGM one month after discharge.\n\nSubstudy 5 - Continuous glucose level for surgical patients in relation to hospitalization in the surgical ward: Compares the continuous glucose levels when glucose monitoring and management are performed by point-of-care FSGM and point-of-care CGMS in the surgical ward. Further, it compares continuous glucose levels using point-of-care FSGM and CGM after discharge.\n\nSubstudy 6 - Accuracy of CGMS for surgical patients during hospitalization: Investigates the accuracy of CGMS by comparing CGMS data with FSGM and plasma glucose data.\n\nSubstudy 7 (qualitative study) - Nursing staff's experience with fingerstick monitoring and CGSM for surgical patients: Compares the nursing staff's experience with point-of-care FSGM to point-of-care CGMS and glucose management for surgical patients."

          "briefSummary": "Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is a common metabolic disease characterized by hyperglycemia resulting from insufficiency, deficiency or absence of the insulin hormone. Chronic hyperglycemia, secondary metabolic and microvascular changes resulting in diabetic neuropathy are among the most common complications encountered in DM patients.\n\nDiabetic neuropathy is called peripheral, autonomic or spinal depending on the region of involvement. Peripheral involvement is more common than other region involvement and its prevalence in DM patients is observed to be 16-87%. Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) presents with numbness, tingling, paresthesia, muscle weakness and pain. These symptoms can start from the toes and progress to the leg and even the upper extremities.\n\nIn diabetic peripheral neuropathy, pain is seen as burning, electric shock or sharp cold pain, increases at night and affects sleep quality. In these patients, daily living activities such as walking, climbing stairs, and sleeping are negatively affected by progressive DPN and pain, falls are observed, mood disorders are experienced, and the quality of life decreases.",
          "detailedDescription": "In the study, the Data Descriptive Characteristics Form, Diabetes Quality of Life Scale, Self-Care Efficacy Scale, Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs Self-Assessment Scale and Visual Analog Scale will be used. Data will be collected using face-to-face interview technique with patients who apply to the Internal Medicine Outpatient Clinic and are diagnosed with Type II Diabetes. The researchers will conduct the data collection process between 09:00-16:00 on weekdays. After the patients are informed about the research, their informed consent will be obtained and they will be included in the study.\n\nThe Descriptive Characteristics Form was developed by the researchers by reviewing the relevant literature. It consists of 17 questions including information such as age, gender, chronic diseases, and medications used.\n\nThe original version of the Diabetes Quality of Life Scale, Diabetes Quality of Life (DQOL) scale was developed in 1988 by the Diabetes Control and Complications Study group.The Turkish culturally compatible version of the DQOL scale consists of four sub-dimensions and a total of 45 questions. The Cronbach α coefficient of the Turkish version of the DQOL scale translated by Yıldırım is 0.89.\n\nSelf-Care Agency Scale: The Self-Care Agency Scale was developed in 1979 and was adapted to Turkish in the Republic of Turkey and its validity and reliability were performed. The scale, which focuses on individuals' self-assessment of their involvement in self-care actions, consists of 35 items. The Cronbach Alpha Internal Consistency Coefficient of the scale was found to be 0.89.\n\nVAS-Visual Analog Scale It is a scale divided into equal distances on a 10 cm horizontal plane with no pain on one side and \"unbearable\" pain on the other side. The patient is asked to mark the point on this line that best expresses the intensity of his/her pain. This distance, measured in millimeters, is interpreted as a \"score\". For pain intensity, 0 points are evaluated as \"no pain\" and 10 points as \"the worst unbearable pain\".\n\nS-LANSS It is used especially in the evaluation of pain types with neuropathic characteristics. - It can be applied easily and quickly at the bedside. It provides the distinction between neuropathic and nociceptive pain. There are 7 items in total, 5 of which are pain questions and 2 of which are allodynia and needle prick test examinations. 0 Its validity and reliability in our country was conducted by Koç in 2008. The Cronbach alpha value of the scale was calculated as 0.74"

          "detailedDescription": "Epidemiologic studies have revealed a tremendous increase in the prevalence of diabetes and related mortality worldwide. The general population-based survey in China in 2010, using the American Diabetes Association (ADA) 2010 criteria, revealed that the prevalence of diabetes and prediabetes in adults was 11.6% and 50.1%, respectively, indicating that China has the highest diabetes prevalence in Asia and largest absolute disease burden of diabetes in the world. Lifestyle changes, aging, and obesity have become the main reasons for this increase in the prevalence of diabetes.\n\nIn order to meet all the challenges in the treatment of metabolic diseases in China, the National Metabolic Management Center (MMC) was founded in 2016. With advanced medical equipment and Internet of Things (IoT) technology, the MMC is committed to creating an online and offline integrated solution for diabetes, and for the entire spectrum of metabolic disease, to achieve a more convenient and precise model of care for patients. The MMC is focused on establishing highly efficient diagnosis and treatment, as well as comprehensive disease management both in and out of hospital. All MMCs in China have the same structure in terms of facilities, layout, and databases, as well as the same routine daily operations, aiming to establish a platform with standardized diagnosis and treatment of metabolic diseases and their long-term follow-up. This platform of treatment is called the'One Center, One Stop, and One Standard Model'.\n\nThe objective of the MMC is to launch a new metabolic disease management model based on the Internet health information platform. It allows the application and evaluation of diabetes treatment strategies at these centers. The proprietary electronic medical database in the MMC will help the dynamic big-data analysis in diabetes epidemiology, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. It will also provide prospective data support including economic evaluation in management of chronic diseases for the Healthy China 2030 strategy.\n\nObjective：\n\n1. The purpose of the present study is to establish a multi-center nationwide prospective database of diabetes patients in MMCs, including clinical data, biological samples library so as to explore the epidemiology, genetics, new biomarkers, risk factors, and prognostic methods related to diabetes and its complications, as well as other metabolic diseases.\n2.

Then patients will be followed by clinical/laboratory visits at MMC every 3-6 month later on according to individualized patient's treatment plans. A repeated comprehensive clinical and laboratory assessment for glycemic and risk factors control, safety, as well as diabetes-specific complications will be scheduled once a year."

          "briefSummary": "Obesity and type 2 diabetes are major causes of illness and premature death worldwide and their incidence is increasing rapidly. Bariatric surgery is considered as the \"gold-standard\" surgical treatment for both conditions.\n\nHowever, not all patients do equally well after surgery and indeed the weight loss experienced by patients undergoing bariatric surgery can vary. As such when patients are seen after bariatric surgery in clinic they fall in one of the following two categories:\n\n1. Good responders: this is the majority of patients who lose the expected amount of weight based on the published studies.\n2. Poor responders: this is a small group of patients who either lose less than the expected amount of weight after bariatric surgery or lose the expected amounts of weight early after surgery but then regain a substantial proportion of the weight they have lost.\n\nThe so-called \"poor responders\" are exposed to all the risks of the operation and do not benefit from the weight loss as much as good responders.\n\nThis study would therefore like to investigate the physiological factors that distinguish poor from good responders before, and after bariatric surgery. The study team hypothesizes that compared to good responders, poor responders exhibit:\n\n1. a smaller degree of fullness sensation after a meal,\n2. a lower energy expenditure after a meal, and\n3. genetic changes (single nucleotide polymorphisms) that predispose the poor responder to development of obesity.\n\nIn addition, the study team hypothesizes that poor responders exhibit:\n\n1. lower gut hormone secretion after a meal and\n2. are less sensitive to the physiological action of gut hormones compared to good responders and that this difference in gut hormone secretion and response to gut hormones prior to bariatric surgery can be helpful to predict response to bariatric surgery."

          "briefSummary": "Mauritius is located in the southern Indian Ocean with a population of 1.3 million in 2023. Mauritius is a multiethnic nation with 68% South Asian, 27% African (Creole), 3% Chinese and 2% Franco Mauritians.\n\nSeven population-based cross-sectional surveys using standardised protocols were conducted between 1987 and 2021). The participation rate has been over 85% in each survey.\n\nAt each survey, participants were interviewed about living conditions, lifestyle and health, and anthropometry and blood pressure were measured. Biochemistry including lipids and an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) were performed Electrocardiograms (ECG) were recorded in participants aged 35 years and older. Previous participants were followed up in 2007 and 92% were successfully traced.\n\nStudies with identical methodology have been performed on the neighbouring island Rodrigues where the majority of the population are Creoles.",
          "detailedDescription": "Mauritius and Rodrigues are islands in the south-eastern part of the Indian Ocean. Major changes in lifestyle have been seen during the last fifty years, including less physical activity and introduction of a westernised diet. In parallel, the disease panorama has changed from high infant mortality and infectious diseases to lifestyle-related diseases such as cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes.\n\nThe population in Mauritius are descendants to immigrants from South Asia, Africa and China, i.e., approximately 60% of the world population are represented. Mauritius is probably the only developing country that has followed the development of non-communicable diseases (NCD) and associated risk factors over a long time-period and continues to do so.\n\nIn the mid-eighties, the Mauritian government initiated a study on the prevalence of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, in collaboration with WHO and international experts. Altogether seven population-based surveys have been performed between 1987 and 2021, and approximately 39 000 (!) examinations have been recorded. The intention is to repeat the survey every fifth year.\n\nThe ethnicities of the participants have been 71% South Asians (India/Pakistan), 24% Creoles (Africa) and 5% Chinese, which reflects well the ethnical distribution of the population. Previous participants were followed up in 2007 and 92% were successfully traced. Studies have also been performed on the neighbouring island Rodrigues where the majority of the population are Creoles. During the follow-up survey in 2010, 97% of the 9 700 participants were traced.\n\nAt each survey, information was given and an individual consent form was signed. See attached the local (in Mauritius) ethical approval and consent form from the Mauritius survey 2021.\n\nAt each survey, participants were interviewed about living conditions, lifestyle and health, and anthropometry and blood pressure were measured. Biochemistry including lipids and an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) were performed Altogether approximately 28 000 electrocardiograms (ECG) were recorded in participants aged 35 years and older, all of which have been coded in Kaunas, Lithuania for signs of ischemic heart disease (Minnesota criteria) and myocardial hypertrophy.\n\nThe Mauritius NCD study was initially administrated by the International Diabetes Institute in Melbourne, Australia under the leadership of Professor Paul Zimmet together with Professor Jaakko Tuomilehto (Finland) and Professor George Alberti (United Kingdom). Today, the study is administrated and financed by the Ministry of health in Mauritius under the leadership of Doctor Sudhir Kowlessur.\n\nProfessor Stefan Söderberg at the Department of Public Health and Clinical Medicine, Umeå University, Sweden was introduced to the Mauritius NCD study during his postdoc (2001-2002) in Professor Zimmet's research team at IDI in Melbourne. Söderberg has since then continued to assist in the performance of the surveys and to analyse data. Today, Umeå university and the Department of Public Health and Clinical medicine have been granted the privilege to curate and analyse data generated in the Mauritius and Rodrigues NCD study.\n\nEach survey has been evaluated and approved by the local ethics committee in Mauritius (see attached the approval from 2021). Analysing data in Sweden has been approved by the Swedish Ethical Authority (2023-07199-01)."

In 1998, the Chinatown cluster was not surveyed. Altogether, 9,559 individuals participated in the first three surveys and 60% of participants took part in more than one survey.\n\nIn 2004, a new study was performed, with similar methodology.

          "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to determine whether the sequence of macronutrient consumption affects post-prandial glycaemia in women with gestational diabetes mellitus.\n\nThe main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* The difference in the magnitude of postprandial rise in blood glucose between the two test meals.\n* The difference in the magnitude of postprandial change in serum levels of gut hormones between the two test meals.\n* The difference in mean change in pre-post ingestion satiety scores between the two test meals.\n* The difference in 24 hour energy and macronutrient intake following the two test meals.\n\nParticipants will attend two study visits at the Centre for Public Health, with an interval of at least two days between the visits and complete the following, anthropometric measurements, demographic and appetite questionnaires, glucose measurements, two food diaries and fasting blood samples and the consumption of the study breakfast. Participants will be asked to eat either the protein/fat-based component of the meal (scrambled egg) before or after the carbohydrate-based component (wholemeal toast) on their first visit and on the other visit they will be asked to eat the meal in the reverse order. The order in which this occurs will be randomised and each participant will act as their own control. Researchers will compare the results from participants between the two test meals to see if the order of macronutrient consumption has any effect on post-prandial glycaemia, gut hormones, satiety scores and energy and macronutrient intake.",
          "detailedDescription": "Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is glucose intolerance with onset or first diagnosis during pregnancy, affecting around 1 in 10 pregnancies in the United Kingdom (UK). Women with GDM are 10 times more likely to develop type 2 DM and twice as likely to develop cardiovascular disease in later life than women without GDM. Dietary modification is recommended as first line management to optimise blood glucose control. However, this often fails, necessitating the use of medication such as metformin and insulin. There is a pressing need to find safe and effective dietary approaches to optimise glycaemic control in GDM which can be easily adhered to in order to improve longer-term outcomes. The impact of the sequence of macronutrients on glycaemic control is an emerging area of interest. Recent evidence suggests that the consumption of the fat/protein components of a meal prior to the carbohydrate components, reduces the peak by around 40% after food. This study aims to determine whether the order that macronutrients (i.e. protein, fat, carbohydrate) are eaten affects; blood sugar glucose levels in the blood after a meal, appetite, food intake and the release of hormones in the body, in women with GDM.\n\nPregnant women with GDM, aged 18-50 years old are eligible for the study. Women are not eligible if they have a history of type 1 or 2 diabetes, any clinically confirmed food allergies, taking medication for GDM, severe nausea or using anti-sickness medication.\n\nRecruitment will be via antenatal clinics in the South-Eastern Health and Social Care Trust (SEHSCT). Participants will attend the Centre for Public Health on two occasions (maximum 2 weeks between visits) and will involve the collection of demographic information, weight and height measurements, blood samples, glucose measurements, consumption of study breakfast, and completion of two 1-day food diaries.\n\nParticipants will be asked to eat either the protein/fat-based component of the meal (scrambled egg) before or after the carbohydrate-based component (wholemeal toast) on their first visit and on the other visit they will be asked to eat the meal in the reverse order. The order in which this occurs will be randomised and each participant will act as their own control. Scrambled egg was chosen as the protein and fat will be homogenously distributed (compared to boiled egg, for example). Wholemeal toast was chosen as, although lower glycaemic index and therefore less likely to expeditiously raise blood glucose than toasted white bread, it will be more consistent with the participants' existing dietary needs."

          "briefSummary": "Recently a new clinical dementia subgroup based on brain imaging, called \"diabetes related dementia (DrD)\". DrD, unlike Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia, is considered a \"controllable\" or \"modifiable\" form of dementia. However, there is currently a lack of corresponding treatment measures. Ginkgo biloba ketone ester tablets are extracts of Ginkgo biloba leaves. Previous studies have shown that they can increase cerebral blood flow, reduce cerebrovascular resistance, improve cerebral circulation, and are beneficial for the treatment of cognitive impairment. This project intends to explore the role of ginkgo ketoester tablets in diabetes related dementia through a multicenter randomized double-blind controlled clinical study.",
          "detailedDescription": "This study was divided into two treatment groups: the experimental group and the control group. 370 type 2 diabetes patients with mild cognitive impairmentpatients were randomly selected and assigned to the experimental group of 185 patients and the control group of 185 patients in a 1:1 equal amount. Experimental group: Ginkgo biloba ketone ester tablets combined with conventional hypoglycemic treatment group, the usage is Ginkgo biloba ketone ester tablets (Styron), taken orally, 3 times a day, 0.5g each time, and continuously administered for 6 months. Control group: conventional hypoglycemic treatment group. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment Basic (MoCA-B) was used for the detection of cognitive dysfunction. Neuropsychological testing of cognitive function was conducted using Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive Scale (ADAS-cog), Auditory Word Learning Test (AVLT-H);Assessment of Daily Living Ability - Functional Activity Questionnaire (FAQ);Shape Connection Test A and B and Symbolic Digital Form Test (SDMT).Collect patients' blood, and detect C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, oxidative stress, ApoE4 genotype, phosphorylated tau protein, irisin, β- Amyloid protein before and after the experiment.Detect changes in ankle brachial pulse wave conduction velocity (baPWV)/and ankle brachial blood pressure index (ABI) of patients before and after the experiment."

          "briefSummary": "This randomized controlled clinical trial will assess whether continuation of home oral antidiabetic agents during hospitalization can be used as a safe and effective alternative to insulin therapy in the management of diabetes in the hospital. The primary outcome of the study is to determine differences in glycemic control as measured by mean daily blood glucose concentration between oral antidiabetic medications and basal bolus therapy in hospitalized patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D).",
          "detailedDescription": "Hyperglycemia in the hospital is common and has been associated with increased hospital complications, length of stay, and mortality. Improving glycemic control has been shown to improve length of stay, multi-organ failure, systemic infections, as well as short- and long-term mortality. Clinical guidelines from professional organizations recommend the use of subcutaneous (SQ) insulin as the preferred therapy for glycemic control in general medical and surgical patients with T2D. This approach, however, is labor intensive requiring multiple daily insulin injections, costly, and associated with significant risk of iatrogenic hypoglycemia\n\nOver 75% of patients with T2D are treated with oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs) but due to the lack of safety and efficacy data from randomized controlled trials, clinical guidelines recommend stopping OADs during hospitalization. The current clinical guidelines have raised concerns with the use of OADs including risk of hypoglycemia with sulfonylureas, fluid retention and worsening of heart failure with thiazolidinediones, and risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis in patients with severe renal impairment. However, several observational studies have reported that the use of OADs results in similar glycemic control without increased risk of complications compared to insulin regimens. A recent observational study that included 17,325 hospitalized patients with T2D, found that patients treated with OADs had similar glycemic control without differences in complications and no increase in rates of hypoglycemia compared to those treated with insulin.\n\nThis study will assess whether continuation of home oral antidiabetic agents during hospitalization can be used as a safe and effective alternative to insulin therapy in the management of diabetes in hospital patients with T2D. For a subset of participants (50 patients per group), a CGM devise will be placed for the duration of the study to assess parameters of glycemic control and hypoglycemia."

          "briefSummary": "The overall goal is to determine how a sleep extension intervention (increasing time in bed) in individuals who maintain less than 6.5 hours sleep per night affects their plasma ceramides and insulin sensitivity. Participants will undergo a randomized controlled trial, with sleep extension (intervention) and healthy lifestyle (control) groups. The sleep extension is designed to increase participant's time in bed by 2 hours per night. Alternatively, the control group will receive basic health information (e.g., physical activity, goal setting, and nutrition when eating out).",
          "detailedDescription": "A randomized controlled trial with real-world sleep extension in adults with overweight and obesity who habitually obtain short sleep duration will be conducted. Group allocation will be 1:1 and research staff and participants will be blinded until the conclusion of the baseline segment. The sleep extension group will receive counseling and instruction to increase nightly time in bed by 2 hours per night. Participants randomized to control will maintain their habitual sleep habits in their home environment. The intervention segment will last 8 weeks regardless of group assignment. Both groups will have equal contact time with the study team.\n\nPrior to enrollment participants will complete a clinical overnight sleep disorders screening. Baseline consists of an \\~1-week ambulatory real-world monitoring segment. Following baseline, participants will be randomized 1:1 to either the sleep extension or control group for 8 weeks at home (intervention segment). Throughout the study, sleep duration will be monitored using an actiwatch wrist-device and a daily electronic sleep log. Following the baseline and intervention segments participants will complete rigorous overnight laboratory visits to assess plasma ceramides (targeted metabolomics assay) and insulin sensitivity (hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp)."

          "briefSummary": "Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) has evolved as a pivotal enzyme in lipid metabolism and therapeutic target for hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD). Furthermore, research from in-vitro and in-vivo animal models suggest that the inhibition of PCSK9 expression may suppress platelet activation, and systemic inflammation thereby reducing thrombotic risk. Taken together, these data support the lower rates of myocardial infarction, stroke, and coronary revascularization in subjects with increased CVD risk in clinical trials with alirocumab (Praluent) and evolocumab (Repatha) as compared to placebo. The main aim of this single center, exploratory in-vitro evaluation is to investigate the direct role of PCSK9 on platelet activation and aggregation using blood collected from a diverse population of antiplatelet naïve healthy volunteers (n=40) and subjects with CVD risk factors (n=40) between the 18-50 years of age. All procedures including consenting, collection of clinical data, and lab processing will occur at the Sinai Center for Thrombosis Research. The results of this study will provide a better understanding of cardioprotective effects of PCSK9 inhibition beyond lipid lowering.",
          "detailedDescription": "The pivotal role of platelets during arterial ischemic events, such as myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and cardiovascular (CV) death, and the significant role of potent antiplatelet therapy in reducing these events have been well defined. An independent association between plasma PCSK9 levels, elevated platelet reactivity, and ischemic outcomes in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) has been demonstrated. The association of plasma PCSK9 levels with coronary artery disease (CAD) risk, independent of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, has been suggested. Based on a meta-analysis of trials of medium-high risk cardiovascular disease (CVD) patients, the investigators have demonstrated a significant mortality and MI reduction with PCSK9 antibodies and suggested a relevant ant ischemic/antiplatelet role of PCSK9 antibodies. These observations support the hypothesis that the anti-ischemic effects of PCSK9 inhibitor therapy are related to its pleiotropic effects on platelets.\n\nIn vitro, animal, and human studies have suggested the direct effects of PCSK9 and PCSK9 inhibitors on platelets. PCSK9 indirectly activates platelets through elevated LDL-C and oxLDL levels. oxLDL can activate platelets by binding to the scavenger receptors CD36 and LOX-1. In addition, a direct relationship between PCSK9 and platelet activation through the scavenger receptors CD36 and Lectin-like oxidized LDL receptor (LOX)-1 has been suggested. Incubation of human recombinant PCSK9 protein with platelet-rich plasma collected from healthy subjects significantly enhanced activated GPIIb/IIIa receptor expression and platelet aggregation induced by suboptimal concentrations of epinephrine. In in vitro experiments, human recombinant PCSK9 exposure enhanced LOX-1 expression in human vascular endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells. Similarly, LOX-1 KO mice showed lower PCSK9 levels and PCSK9-KO mice showed much lower LOX-1 levels, indicating a reciprocal relationship between PCSK9 and LOX-1. A similar reciprocal relationship between PCSK9 levels and LOX-1 and CD36 expression has not been demonstrated in human platelets.\n\nIn vitro immunoblotting experiments demonstrated the presence of PCSK9 in platelets obtained from patients with CAD, and flow cytometry experiments demonstrated that collagen-related peptide (CP) significantly enhanced the surface expression of PCSK9 on platelets. Furthermore, PCSK9 antibodies significantly inhibited ADP- and CP-induced platelet aggregation and platelet-dependent thrombus formation on the immobilized collagen surface under high shear rate (1000s-1). Binding of PCSK9 to CD36 triggers platelet activation through activation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase (Nox)2, release of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and subsequent activation of GPIIb/IIIa receptor and p-selectin release. In addition, Nox2 induces the generation of 8-Iso-prostaglandin F2α and thromboxane (Tx) A2 through the activation f cytosolic phospholipase A2 and finally results in the activation of the GP-IIb/IIIa receptor and p-selectin release. The relationship between plasma PCSK9, urinary 11-dehydro-TxB2, and CV events in patients with atrial fibrillation has been demonstrated. Furthermore, washed platelets resuspended in plasma from patients with familial hypercholesterolemia after PCSK9 inhibitor treatment induced lower platelet aggregation and soluble Nox2-derived peptide (sNox2-dp) release than those obtained using plasma before PCSK9 inhibitor treatment in an in vitro study. This reduction was reversed by the addition of oxLDL. Furthermore, oxLDL-induced platelet aggregation was reduced by inhibiting CD36, LOX-1, and Nox2. In the same study, 6-month treatment with PCSK9 inhibitors was shown to reduce serum LDL-C, oxLDL, serum TxB2, sNox2-dp, and PCSK9 levels.\n\nThese preliminary observations suggest that:\n\n* CV benefits associated with PCSK9 inhibitor therapy may be in part related to its pleiotropic effects on platelets.\n* In vitro, animal, and clinical studies suggested direct effects of PCSK9 on platelets.\n* PCSK9 influence platelet function through CD36/LOX-1 receptor mediated Nox2 activity.\n\nHowever, the potential direct platelet effects of PCSK9 on platelets have not been demonstrated in a comprehensive study involving a diverse population of healthy volunteers and subjects with cardiovascular risk factors. Inclusion of at least 3 CV risk factors will increase the chance of finding subjects with an elevated platelet reactivity phenotype and demonstration of enhanced platelet-related effect of PCSK9. The presence of these risk factors has been traditionally attributed to increased prevalence of CVD and associated risk.\n\nIn contemporary CV clinical trials, a very low percentage (\\<10%) of African Americans are represented despite a more pronounced CVD risk. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that PCSK9 levels are significantly higher in African Americans vs Caucasians (104 ± 29 vs 95 ± 30 ng/mL, respectively; P = 0.020). At Sinai Hospital of Baltimore, the investigators have reported higher rates of post-PCI ischemic events and greater mortality in African Americans than in Whites. Rare loss-of-function (LoF) mutations of PCSK9 have been associated with low levels of LDL-C (28% lower in Blacks and 15% in Whites) and with an even more impressive reduction in the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) (88% and 47%, respectively). PCSK9 LoF variants were associated with 35 mg/dL and 13 mg/dL lower LDL-C levels in African Americans and Caucasians, respectively, and a 49% and 18% lower risk for coronary heart disease in African Americans and Caucasians, respectively. In a study of 10,196 US African American adults, PCSK9 LoF variants were associated with lower concentrations of lipoprotein (Lpa) and OxPL-apoB. These data indicate a direct relationship between PCSK9 and the risk of CAD, and the importance of lowering PCSK9 levels in reducing CAD risk among African Americans.\n\nThe knowledge gained by our exploratory mechanistic study will help us to understand the direct effects of PCSK9 and PCSK9 inhibitor on platelets and facilitate the clinical application of PCSK9 inhibitors in a broad range of patients with cardiovascular risk."

          "briefSummary": "The goal of this study investigate if pregnant women with a history of gestational diabetes (GDM) have better pregnancy outcomes if they test their blood glucose four times a day early in the pregnancy versus having an oral glucose tolerance test later in the pregnancy at 28 weeks in their current pregnancy.\n\nPopulation being studied:\n\nAll pregnant women who had a history of GDM in a previous pregnancy\n\nStudy groups:\n\n1. Women who are being managed in the pregnancy with early blood glucose monitoring (early monitoring group)\n2. Women who are being managed with an oral glucose tolerance test at 28-32 weeks (late monitoring group)\n\nThis study has two parts (i) observational and (ii) mechanistic or laboratory based.\n\nIn the observational part of the study, data will be collected as standard of care across different obstetric units and this data will be used to:\n\n1. compare the outcomes of the women such as need for labour to be induced, caesarean section rates, blood loss, need for treatment of their blood glucose with metformin or insulin, HbA1c values\n2. compare the outcomes of the offspring such as birth weight centiles, shoulder dystocia or birth trauma, hypoglycaemia, jaundice and if admitted to the neonatal unit.\n\nThe mechanistic or laboratory part of the study is aimed at studying how the two different treatment approaches affect:\n\n1. the metabolome of the pregnant woman - urine and blood samples collected at two time points will be used and mass spectrometry used to determine the amino acid and lipid profiles.\n2. the microbiome differs between both groups\n3. the pathways that regulate insulin in the placenta\n4. the ability of the cells in the umbilical cord differentiate into the different fat cells.",
          "detailedDescription": "Gestational diabetes rates are globally increasing and it is now well known that women who had gestational diabetes have a recurrent risk ranging from 35.5% to 70% in a future pregnancy. Some of these women may have preexisting type 2 diabetes or glucose intolerance There is also now convincing evidence that the women with GDM are at increased risk of T2DM and cardiovascular disorders. GDM can also affect the health of the offspring and associated with an increased risk of future obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disorders, possibly modulated through altered epigenetics of the fetus. The recent NICE guidance has recommended that women with a history of GDM should be offered early pregnancy glucose monitoring or testing with oral glucose tolerance test at 24-28 weeks. Gestational diabetes is associated with derangement in amino acid and lipid pathways and these changes can be demonstrated several weeks prior to the diagnosis of GDM. Similarly, both candidate gene and genome wide studies have reported that GDM exposure is associated with significant changes in the infant's or child's DNA methylation, with a recent meta-analysis of seven pregnancy cohorts identified differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with GDM within OR2L13 and CYP2E1. Others have also been able to demonstrate that GDM-associated methylation is associated with offspring obesity and T2DM.\n\nThere is emerging evidence that in pregnancy gestational diabetes can occur as early as the first trimester. However in clinical practice, screening and diagnosis does not occur until 28 weeks in the pregnancy, suggesting that in some cases the fetus may be exposed to undetected hyperglycaemia much earlier. There is varying practice in how a pregnant women with a history of GDM is managed in a future pregnancy. Some are offered early capillary blood glucose testing four times a day as early as 10 weeks (early monitoring), while others are offered diagnostic testing with an oral glucose tolerance test at 28 weeks (late monitoring). This study was designed to compare the pregnancy outcomes between the early and the late monitoring approaches to determine which is more effective in modulating the maternal metabolome, placental insulin signalling pathways and offspring DNA methylation. Equally important the multi-centre observational arm will allow comparison of maternal and neonatal outcomes between both groups."

          "briefSummary": "Heart failure (HF) is a major cause of hospital admissions in the US, with over 6 million hospital days annually.\n\nMore than 40% of hospitalized patients with HF have diabetes mellitus (DM), which increases the risk of recurrent hospitalizations for HF with reduced and preserved ejection fraction by more than two-fold. Current methods for assessing glycemic control do not consider fluctuations in blood glucose levels, known as glycemic variability. High glycemic variability is a poor prognostic marker for HF re-hospitalizations. Given the significant prevalence and impact of DM in individuals with HF, it is crucial to examine whether improving glycemic control and avoiding hypoglycemia could lead to a decrease in HF readmissions. Real-time continuous glucose monitoring (rt-CGM), which provides glucose measurements as frequently as every 5 minutes, has improved glycemic control in insulin-treated adults with DM compared to the standard of care, capillary point-of-care blood glucose testing (POC). Researchers will monitor participants during their hospital stay and 3 months after discharge.",
          "detailedDescription": "HF is one of the leading causes of hospitalization among older adults. Nearly 1 in 4 HF patients are readmitted within 30 days of discharge and despite various strategies, the re-hospitalization rates remain high. HF hospitalization has an impact on morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. Therefore, it is crucial to identify and implement effective strategies to reduce the health and economic burden of HF re-hospitalization. Diabetes mellitus (DM) is one of the most common comorbidities in HF, impacting approximately a third of all patients. Several studies have reported that HF patients with DM have higher rates of recurrent HF hospitalizations, longer durations of hospital stay, and significantly higher mortality compared to HF patients without DM. Given the high prevalence and impact of DM on HF prognosis, it is important to understand how optimizing DM control can affect and improve the prognosis in this population. Glucose monitoring is central to safe and effective management for individuals with DM, particularly those using insulin. Recent studies have shown that real-time (rt) continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), by providing glucose measurements as often as every 5 minutes, low and high glucose alerts, and glucose trend information, with the potential to better inform diabetes management decisions compared with episodic self-monitoring with a blood glucose meter.\n\nThis pilot study will examine the potential benefits of remote glucose monitoring by rt-CGM-driven decisions for the hospital and post-discharge management patients with comorbid HF and DM."

          "briefSummary": "The Argentine Registry on Lipoprotein(a) (LP(a)), orchestrated by the Argentine Group for LP(a) Study, stands as a pioneering and extensive prospective initiative. This registry systematically collects geolocation data, including patient postal codes, demographic information, and a multifaceted array of health parameters to unravel the intricate associations surrounding LP(a) levels.\n\nThe dataset encompasses diverse patient characteristics, ranging from standard metrics like blood pressure, weight, and race to broader factors such as diabetes, smoking habits, menopausal status, and hypothyroidism. This holistic approach enables a nuanced exploration of the interplay between LP(a) levels and various risk factors, providing invaluable insights for both clinical and public health considerations.\n\nOne distinctive feature of this registry lies in its focus on medication history, shedding light on the impact of routine pharmaceutical interventions on LP(a) profiles. Additionally, it delves into the intricate web of inflammatory diseases, recognizing their potential role in LP(a) modulation.\n\nGenetic predispositions are meticulously examined, with a specific emphasis on identifying homozygous and heterozygous variants associated with hypercholesterolemia. This genetic dimension adds a layer of complexity to the understanding of LP(a) dynamics, contributing significantly to the ongoing discourse on cardiovascular risk.\n\nThe prospective nature of this registry allows for dynamic analyses, fostering a continuous exploration of emerging patterns and trends. By amalgamating geographical, clinical, and genetic data, the Argentine LP(a) Registry emerges as a comprehensive platform poised to unlock novel facets of LP(a) biology and its implications for cardiovascular health. As the dataset matures, it holds the promise of guiding personalized interventions and refining risk stratification strategies, thereby advancing the landscape of preventive cardiovascular care."

          "briefSummary": "Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss in working-age Americans. Capillary damage from hyperglycemia causes vision loss through downstream effects, such as retinal ischemia, edema, and neovascularization (NV). Proper screening and timely treatment with laser photocoagulation and anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) injections can minimize morbidity. In the last decade, clinicians have been able to use objective structural data from optical coherence tomography (OCT) to guide the treatment of diabetic macular edema. Other aspects of care, however, still largely depend on subjective interpretation of clinical features and fluorescein angiography (FA) to determine the disease severity and treatment threshold. The recently developed OCT angiography (OCTA) provides dye-less, injection-free, three-dimensional images of the retinal and choroidal circulation with high capillary contrast. Not only is it safer, faster, and less expensive than conventional dye-based angiography, OCTA provides the potential of giving clinicians objective tools for determining severity of disease by detecting and quantifying NV and non-perfusion."
