          "briefSummary": "Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is a leading cause of chronic and end-stage kidney disease, affecting 25-40% of type 1 diabetes (T1D) patients and 5-40% of type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients. Despite standard treatments like ACE inhibitors and ARBs, many patients continue to develop DKD, indicating a need for better kidney protection. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin combined with insulin in early DKD patients with T1DM, using ACEi/ARB as standard treatment, to provide new insights into kidney protection and support precision medicine goals.",
          "detailedDescription": "This is an open-label, randomized, parallel-group study to evaluate the effects of dapagliflozin on urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (UACR) in participants with early diabetic nephropathy and type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). The primary objective is to assess the changes in UACR and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) before and after dapagliflozin treatment in these patients. Secondary objectives include observing blood glucose control, weight improvement, and safety evaluation after dapagliflozin treatment.\n\nThe study comprises three groups: dapagliflozin 10 mg, dapagliflozin 5 mg, and a standard treatment control, with a 1:1:1 allocation ratio. Participants meeting the inclusion criteria and not meeting any exclusion criteria will enter a 4-8 week lead-in period, during which they will receive the maximum tolerable dose of ACEI/ARB medications, maintain this treatment for at least 4 weeks, and optimize blood glucose control under the guidance of medical professionals while wearing continuous glucose monitoring devices. Starting from baseline, participants will receive either dapagliflozin 5 mg or 10 mg once daily for 24 weeks, while the control group will continue on the maximum tolerable dose of ACEI/ARB medications. Continuous glucose monitoring and regular ketone monitoring will be performed to prevent diabetic ketoacidosis. Follow-up visits will occur approximately 30 days after the last dose of study medication or upon study completion.\n\nThe primary efficacy indicators are the mean changes in UACR and eGFR from baseline to week 24. Secondary efficacy indicators include changes in 24-hour urine biochemistry, HbA1c, body weight, continuous glucose monitoring indices, and total daily insulin dose. Safety evaluation indicators include adverse events, serious adverse events, diabetic ketoacidosis, severe hypoglycemia, and urinary or genital infections."

          "briefSummary": "This study is a randomized, non-blinded clinical trial specifically designed to assess the initial feasibility and efficacy of SGLT2 inhibitors in treating NAFLD among adults diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.",
          "detailedDescription": "Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a metabolic liver disease that encompasses a spectrum of progressive pathological changes, ranging from simple steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Epidemiological data demonstrate a close association between type 2 diabetes and NAFLD. Approximately 49% to 62% of individuals with type 2 diabetes have concurrent NAFLD, and those with NAFLD have a risk of developing diabetes more than twice that of the general population. NAFLD not only increases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes but also accelerates the progression of diabetes-related target organ damage, leading to adverse metabolic and cardiovascular risks. Currently, there is a global lack of comprehensive public health strategies for addressing NAFLD, and clinically, there are still no approved drugs specifically for treating NAFLD.\n\nNAFLD is diagnosed through abnormal liver function test results and imaging examinations. The NAFLD Fibrosis Score (NFS) and Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) Index can be used for clinical screening of NASH in individuals with type 2 diabetes. Ultrasound attenuation parameters (UAP) and liver stiffness measurements (LSM) based on transient elastography (TE) can accurately differentiate between liver steatosis and the degree of liver fibrosis. This technique, known for its non-invasive, safe, and reproducible nature, has found widespread application in diagnosing the extent of liver fat and fibrosis in patients with chronic liver diseases.\n\nThe primary approach to treating NAFLD involves modifying poor lifestyle habits, however, lifestyle changes are often difficult to sustain in the long term. Currently, neither the U.S. FDA nor the European Medicines Agency has approved any medications specifically for NAFLD treatment. Given the central role of insulin resistance in the development of NAFLD, hypoglycemic medications have become a new focus in the prevention and treatment of NAFLD. Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors, by inhibiting SGLT-2 activity, reduce the reabsorption of glucose in the proximal renal tubules, causing excess glucose to be excreted in the urine, thereby lowering blood sugar. Reports suggest that SGLT-2 inhibitors also have several other beneficial effects, including reducing the risk of cardiovascular and kidney diseases, improving blood pressure control, aiding weight reduction, and lowering liver fat content. Previous studies have shown that SGLT-2 inhibitors can improve alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, and the FIB-4 Index in patients with type 2 diabetes complicated by NAFLD, potentially exhibiting anti-fibrotic effects on the liver. Henagliflozin, the SGLT-2 inhibitor used in this study, is a compound independently developed with intellectual property by Jiangsu Hengrui Medicine Co., Ltd. Henagliflozin has demonstrated efficacy and safety in monotherapy for inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes patients with poor diet and exercise control or in combination with metformin for inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes patients.\n\nThis study aims to observe the clinical efficacy of henagliflozin treatment for type 2 diabetes complicated by NAFLD in individuals, evaluating its potential to improve liver fat changes and fibrosis indicators in NAFLD, promoting NASH regression, and alleviating the progression of liver fibrosis, building upon lifestyle changes and basic treatments. The secondary objectives include investigating the effects of henagliflozin on liver fat content, visceral fat area, liver enzymes, and blood sugar improvement."

          "briefSummary": "This is a randomized controlled trial to determine whether a low-carbohydrate (LC) diet can lead to normalized blood glucose levels in patients with short duration of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Previous studies have shown that caloric restricted diet leading to weight loss can normalize blood glucose levels in approximately 50% of patients with a short duration of diabetes type 2. However, caloric restriction is difficult to maintain. Less restrictive approaches are needed. The hypothesis in this study is that Low carbohydrate diet can results in normalized blood glucose levels in T2D and can be an alternative to caloric restriction diet, both in the shorter term (3 months) and longer term (15 months). The outcome of this study leading to reduction of HbA1c is important for prevention of diabetes complications.",
          "detailedDescription": "Background Overweight and obesity raise the risk of hyperglycemia which is among the strongest risk factors for morbidity and mortality globally, linked to type 2 diabetes (T2D) as well as, e.g., cardiovascular diseases (CVD), several cancers, dementia, complicated pregnancies and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.1 The link between obesity, T2D and CVD is partially explained by the visceral adiposity and ectopic (e.g., hepatic) fat associated with insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, arterial stiffness, high blood pressure and dyslipidaemia constituting the metabolic syndrome.2,3 Recent studies have demonstrated that diet-induced weight loss, averaging just over 10 kg at 12-months, can effectively normalize blood glucose levels in T2D in a large proportion of patients. While energy-restrictive diets can enable rapid weight loss, any restrictive diet can be difficult to maintain over time. Strict weight loss diet is difficult to follow. Less restrictive approaches that can be adopted as part of a healthy lifestyle would be ideal.\n\nCardiovascular complications are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality among patients with diabetes. 29 The mechanisms of diabetes mellitus-associated progression of atherosclerosis are not fully understood. Hyperglycemia has been shown to cause increased oxidative stress arising from oxi-dative degradation of glucose metabolites. Similarly, advanced glycosylation endproducts (AGEs), which are the result of intracellular hyperglycemia, have been shown to be involved in mediating vascular damage. Furthermore hyperglycemia has been reported that to lead to a hypercoagulable state.29 Low carbohydrate diet has recently gained popularity. Rresearch questions remain on if LC diet with low GI can lead to normalization of blood glucose levels and decrease cardiovascular risk markers. The ideal energy percentage (E%) of carbohydrate in the diet for optimal glucose levels is unclear. Caloric restriction diet has shown best results for normalisation of blood glucose levels. There are no previous studies comparing LC diet with caloric restricted diet in regard to normalization of blood glucose levels. The main goal of this study is to evaluate if LC with low GI can lead to normalization or improvement of blood glucose levels in type 2 diabetes (T2D) and to explore the mechanism for normalization of blood glucose levels after LC diet and caloric restricted diet.\n\nThe main hypothesis in this study is that Low carbohydrate diet can results in normalization or improvement of blood glucose levels in patients with T2D with short duration of disease both in the shorter term (3 months) and longer term (15 months).\n\n286 patients with type 2 diabetes will be included in this study. Patients will be randomized to a low Carb diet or a low caloric diet for 15 months.\n\nPrevious study on caloric restriction diet (DIRECT trial) showed normalization of blood glucose levels in 46% of participants after 12 months. Previous studies on LC diet have shown different results on blood glucose levels based on differences in study design. The greater the carbohydrate restriction, the greater glucose lowering effect. There is a lack of studies reporting normalisation of blood glucose levels. Therefore, it was assumed that LC dietary strategies can result in normalization of blood glucose levels in 30% of patients with T2D after 3 and 15 months. Using an online sample size calculator for a study power of 80% and alpha value of 0.05 the sample size was calculated to 143 participants in each group.\n\nAnthropometric data and blood samples will be collected at baseline and after 3 months (initial weight loss and remission) months (continued weight loss and remission), and 15 months (weight maintenance). For security reason Hb1c and lipid status will be analyzed after changes in medication. For Standardized measurement protocols, instruments (e.g., for anthropometrics), collection tubes, etc. will be used. HbA1c, glucose, lipids and other standard biochemical variables will be measured directly on the day of the visit at the laboratories, or, for substances sensitive to batch effects (e.g., serum insulin), after collection and freezing at -80°C. Samples that are not analyzed immediately will be stored in a biobank for later use. The study will be performed in accordance with GCP.\n\nControlled diet that leads to weight reduction can reverse type 2 diabetes or delay the diagnosis of T2D. According to the report from the Swedish Institute for Health and Healthcare Economi (IHE) decreasing the blood sugar levels in patient with T2D will spare 800 cases of heart infarction, 500 cases of stroke, 450 cases of kidney failure and 20 cases of blindness. Delaying the diabetes diagnosis is beneficial for the patients since the diabetes complications are directly correlated to the diabetes duration. Patient with type 2 diabetes who change their diet with less carbohydrate have shown to need less insulin. The cost of diabetes disease is affected by the cost of medications and the cost of complications of diabetes. Improved knowledge about which diet can reverse T2D and improve glucose levels will in the end affect the cost for the type 2 diabetes. Dietary intervention which effectively improve blood sugar levels will have significant positive health economic effects. The result from this study will be used for diet recommendation for patients with T2D.\n\nBoth men and women will be included in the study. Sex will also be one of the factors in randomisation to assure both groups have equal percent of men and women. Gender is considered a risk factor for obesity. Previous studies have shown that being female doubles the chance of becoming overweight. It is known that lifestyle intervention programs are effective in the prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus in high-risk populations. However, most studies report poorly about the influence of sex and/or gender effectiveness of these interventions. Male sex is acknowledged as a diabetes risk factor. Men are marginally higher affected by diabetes all over the world. They are diagnosed at younger age and at lower levels of overweight/obesity. Women on the other hand are the majority of participants in weight loss studies (This was also observed this in our study investigating the effect of intermittent fasting). Women show greater weight control involvement and thus seek medical help for weight loss therapy/surgery earlier. It is not known if men and women have different preference for LC-diet or caloric restriction as strategies for weigh maintenance. We will be able to compare the remission rate for T2D in men and women."

          "briefSummary": "The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of date consumption on hedonic hunger and appetite hormones in individuals diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n* Does date consumption reduce hedonic hunger in individuals with type 2 diabetes?\n* Does persimmon consumption change Ghrelin, GLP-1 and GIP concentrations in individuals with Type 2 diabetes?\n* Does persimmon consumption reduce HOMA-IR and HbA1c values in individuals with Type 2 diabetes?\n* Does consumption of persimmon reduce LDL cholesterol, total cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations in individuals with type 2 diabetes? To see the effects of date consumption on hedonic hunger and appetite hormones, the researchers will compare individuals with type 2 diabetes who consume 3 dates daily with individuals with type 2 diabetes who do not.\n\nParticipants:\n\n* Individuals in the intervention group will consume 3 (25 g) Baghdad dates (15 g CHO) daily as part of the breakfast meal, while individuals in the control group will not consume dates.\n* Three interviews will be conducted with patients.\n* A record of blood findings and questionnaires will be kept during these interviews.",
          "detailedDescription": "1. Study Design and Participants The sample of this randomised controlled clinical trial will consist of adult individuals with Type 2 diabetes who apply to Erzurum City Hospital Internal Medicine outpatient clinic. A control group will be formed with individuals with Type 2 diabetes in the same age group. Informed Voluntary Consent Form will be obtained from the individuals before starting the study. Power analysis was performed to determine the sample size. The study population was determined as 70 individuals with the G-power programme. In this randomised controlled study, individuals will be randomly assigned to the intervention and control groups using a computer generated list.\n2. Intervention and Control Groups Individuals who agree to participate in the study will be randomly assigned to the intervention and control groups. The study consists of three stages. The first interview will take place at week 0, the second interview at week 6 and the last interview at week 12. The control group will not be intervened by not giving any additional food and will be asked not to consume dates during the study. The intervention group will be informed at the first interview about which meal and in what quantity they will consume dates. Dates will be delivered to participants at baseline (6-week supply) and at week 6 of the study (6-week supply). Individuals in the intervention group will consume 3 (25 g) Baghdad dates (15 g CHO) daily as part of the breakfast meal. Individuals will be given weekly recording sheets to record their date consumption. The diaries will be collected fortnightly to ensure dates are consumed as directed (a photo of the diary will be requested via email or social media). Individuals will receive a fortnightly telephone reminder.\n3. Questionnaire Form Information such as socio-demographic characteristics, smoking and alcohol consumption status, health status, medication used in diabetes treatment, etc. will be obtained through a face-to-face questionnaire. Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) will be used for subjective hunger. The questionnaire form will also include the Food Power Scale for the assessment of hedonic hunger, the International Physical Activity Questionnaire short form (IPAQ-SF) for the assessment of physical activity levels and three-day Food Consumption Records for the assessment of food consumption.\n4. Anthropometric Measurements In the study, anthropometric measurements of individuals will be taken at 0. 6. and 12. weeks. Height will be measured with a stadiometer (SECA 213) with an accuracy of 0.1 cm with the feet side by side and the head in the Frankort plane. Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) (TanitaBC-730) will be used to evaluate body weight and body composition. The measurements will be performed by the researcher.\n5. Biochemical analyses Blood samples taken from the individuals at weeks 0 and 12 will be analysed in the Biochemistry Laboratory of Atatürk University Research Hospital. Fasting blood glucose, fasting blood insulin, HbA1c, Ghrelin, GLP-1, GIP total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglyceride analyses will be performed. Fasting blood glucose, fasting blood insulin, HbA1c, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglycerides are the tests routinely requested by the doctor. Blood samples for ghrelin, GLP-1 and GIP analyses will be collected and analysed separately in the laboratory. Fasting blood glucose and insulin values of individuals who will be used in homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) will be measured. Fasting and postprandial blood glucose will be measured with a glucometer at 0, 6 and 12 weeks of the study.\n\n   * Statistical analyses will be performed using SPSS version 22 software."

          "briefSummary": "The main objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of fully automated closed-loop glucose control on renal tissue oxygenation among people with type 2 diabetes and stage 3 chronic kidney disease.\n\nThis is a single-center, open-label parallel design study that will compare 26 weeks of fully-automated closed-loop glucose control with standard insulin therapy and continuous glucose monitoring, following a run-in period. A total of up to 76 adults with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease will be recruited through outpatient diabetes and nephrology clinics.\n\nThe primary outcome is renal tissue oxygenation measured using blood oxygenation level-dependent magnetic resonance imaging at 26 weeks. Other key outcomes include glycated hemoglobin at 26 weeks and time spent with glucose levels within and above the target glucose range (3.9-10.0mmol/L). Other glycemic and renal outcomes (including renal function) will also be assessed, as well as patient-reported outcome measures using validated questionnaires. Safety evaluations include severe hypoglycemic episodes and other adverse and serious adverse events.",
          "detailedDescription": "Recruitment:\n\nThe investigators aim to recruit 76 participants through the Service of Endocrinology, Diabetes, and Metabolism and through the Nephrology and Hypertension Service at the University Hospital of Lausanne (CHUV), as well as other outpatient diabetes clinics in the canton of Vaud if needed.\n\nScreening visit:\n\nPotential participants will have the opportunity to ask questions and will give written informed consent if interested in participating in the study. A screening blood test and urine pregnancy test will be done at this visit.\n\nBaseline visit:\n\nThe baseline assessment will consist of a medical history, height and weight measurement, waist-hip ratio measurement, blood pressure measurement, and a spot urine collection. Participants will also answer questionnaires to assess patient-reported outcome measures and undergo a renal MRI. A masked glucose sensor will be worn for 14 days.\n\nVisit 3:\n\nRandomisation will occur in a 1:1 ratio using REDCap to the use of fully closed-loop therapy or standard insulin therapy with continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) for 26 weeks once the participants complete the masked CGM period. Participants will attend the research center and receive training on study devices (closed-loop system or CGM) and study devices will be initiated.\n\nVisit 4:\n\nParticipants will attend the research center around two days after initiation of the study arm to discuss potential issues related to use of study devices. This visit can also be conducted by phone.\n\nTelephone contacts:\n\nParticipants in both arms will be contacted by telephone 1 week after initiation of the study arm, as well as at one, two, four, and five months after initiation of study arm to discuss any issues with devices, adverse events, or changes to medications.\n\nVisit 5 (3 month visit):\n\nParticipants will attend the research center and fill-out questionnaires and a blood test and urine analysis will be performed.\n\nVisit 6 (6 month visit):\n\nParticipants will attend the research center and fill-out questionnaires and a blood test and urine analysis will be performed. A renal MRI will be repeated at this visit. Study devices will be returned, and participants will resume their usual diabetes care.\n\nPatient-reported outcomes:\n\nPatient-reported outcome measures will be assessed using five validated questionnaires: Diabetes Distress Scale, Hypoglycemia Attitudes and Behavior Scale, Audit of Diabetes-Dependent Quality of Life, Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire - status version, Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire - change version\n\nSafety outcomes:\n\nSafety outcomes will include the number of severe hypoglycemia episodes, as well as the nature and severity of other adverse events including serious adverse events."

Kidney oxygenation will be examined before treatment start and after 24 weeks using BOLD-MRI (blood oxygen level-defendant MRI), a non-invasive method available for measurement of tissue oxygenation levels that is comparable with direct invasive measurement of partial oxygen pressure. Blood and urin samples will be collected in connection to these visits. The primary endpoint is the change in medullary and cortical R2\\* (inversely proportional to the tissue oxygenation content) after 24 weeks. Secondary endpoints will be albuminuria and urinary levels of ROS (evaluated by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy with CPH spin probes).",
          "detailedDescription": "Aims\n\nThe general aim of this study is to investigate the effects of systemic administration of Evrenzo (Roxadustat \\[RD\\]) or Aranesp (darbepoetin alpha \\[DA\\]) on the levels of renal oxygenation in patients with diabetic nephropathy and associated anemia.\n\nThe investigation will elucidate if RD, a prolyl-hydroxylase (PHD) inhibitor and subsequent Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1 (HIF) activator, can reduce renal hypoxia, compared to DA, which lacks effects on HIF.\n\nBackground\n\nDiabetes complications represent a huge health problem and concern for modern diabetes therapy, with dramatic consequences for the affected individuals and society.\n\nDiabetic kidney disease (DKD) is the most common cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and accounts for a high morbidity and mortality rate in patients with diabetes. Today, the treatment for DKD focuses on optimizing the patients' metabolic control, blood lipid levels and blood pressure, which unfortunately is optimally achieved in just a restricted portion of patients (1). Thus, there is a great need of identifying novel therapies that could improve or prevent progression DKD.\n\nWhile hyperglycemia is the major factor contributing to the development of diabetes complications, the role of hypoxia has recently become increasingly evident as another central factor in all diabetes complications (2). Several effects may contribute to the development of hypoxia in diabetes, including deficient blood supply secondary to micro- and macro-vascular disease, poor local oxygen diffusion secondary to local oedema, or as a result of increased oxygen consumption (3, 4, 5, 6).\n\nHIF-1, a heterodimeric transcription factor, is a central regulator of cellular adaptive response to hypoxia (7). HIF consists of two subunits (alpha and beta), both constitutively expressed in mammalian cells. In normoxia, HIF-1alpha is continuously degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system because of the oxygen-dependent hydroxylation of two key proline residues catalyzed by a group of enzymes known as prolyl-hydroxylases (PHDs) (7). Upon hypoxia, this degradation pathway is suppressed and HIF-1alpha is stabilized, translocates to the nucleus where it dimerizes with HIF-1beta and induces the expression of more than 800 genes involved in angiogenesis, glycolytic energy metabolism, proliferation and survival that enables the cells to adapt to reduced oxygen availability (8, 9). HIF-1 is central for expression of several angiogenic growth factors (e.g., VEGF, erythropoietin (EPO), stromal cell-derived factor-1alpha) (10).\n\nLately, accumulating evidence points to a defective cellular response to hypoxia in diabetes. This defective hypoxia response has been shown to be present in all tissues that develop complications in both animal models for diabetes and in patients with diabetes as a consequence of impaired HIF signaling, and there is a direct suppressive effect of hyperglycemia on HIF function (11). Studies in animal models of diabetes have demonstrated that restoring HIF function in hyperglycemia can prevent the development of multiple diabetes complications, including DKD (7).\n\nRD is a PHD inhibitor that stabilizes HIF-1 by preventing PHD dependent degradation of HIF-1alpha, and has recently been approved for treatment of renal anemia. As hypoxia plays a central pathogenic role even in the early stages of DKD (12), and activation of HIF signaling has recently been demonstrated to have protective effects in animal models of DKD (13), it is of great interest to also investigate the potential role of RD as a targeted therapy for DKD in humans.\n\nThe presently proposed project aims to investigate the potential of RD to improve renal oxygenation in patients with DKD and anemia, compared to DA which lacks the above-mentioned effects on HIF and is an alternative treatment for the same condition. To examine this the investigators plan to use BOLD-MRI (blood oxygen level-defendant MRI), a non-invasive method available for measurement of tissue oxygenation levels that is comparable with direct invasive measurement of partial oxygen pressure (14).\n\nResearch design\n\nThe research design is a randomized prospective, open-label study with parallel groups of 15 participants/group with non-dialysis dependent DKD CKD stage 3-4 with Hb \\<10g/dl (the level of Hb recommended for RD/DA treatment). One group will receive Roxadustat (Evrenzo) three times weekly at an initial dose of 70mg (for body weight \\<100.0 kg) or 100 mg (for body weight weight ≥100.0 kg). The control group will receive darbepoietin alpha (Aranesp) s.c. 0.45mg/kg once a week. The dosage for both arms will be adjusted to keep Hb at the recommended levels between 11-12g/dl.\n\nKidney oxygenation will be evaluated using BOLD-MRI prior to start of therapy, and once again after 24 weeks of treatment with either RD or DA. Primary endpoint is the change in medullary and cortical R2\\* (inversely proportional to the tissue oxygenation content) after 24 weeks. Secondary endpoints will be albuminuria and urinary levels of ROS (evaluated by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy with CPH spin probes)."

          "briefSummary": "In partnership with youth, parents, and community members the investigators have co-developed a program of research designed to address the substantial health disparities faced by First Nations children and families, and the calls to action from the Truth and Reconciliation Report. Specifically; the investigators aim to address the high rates of kidney disease in Indigenous children living with Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), by identifying and understanding the root causes for progression of kidney disease and working together to build an evidenced based, novel therapy for diabetes that focuses on mindfulness, personal strengths and incorporates traditional medicine practices that are meaningful to patients.\n\nThe investigators have planned 2 pilots in order to address the uncertainties surrounding the planning of a larger definitive trial and allow adequate engagement and building of a meaningful traditional medicine component. These pilots will inform the development of a co-designed, feasible, and embraced Dialectical Behavioural Therapy (DBT) skills training and traditional teachings intervention, which is adequately powered to examine effectiveness on outcomes such as mental wellness, medication adherence, and improved glycemic control and renal function.\n\nResearch Aims: 1. Determine the recruitment, enrollment and adherence rates to the intervention. 2. Evaluate acceptability of the intervention using traditional qualitative methods and Indigenous world view methodology 3. Determine the estimated effect size required to power a large-scale DBT randomized control trial for the outcomes quality of life (primary), glycemic control and albuminuria (secondary).\n\nStudy Hypotheses: 1. The investigators hypothesize that a DBT intervention will be feasible on a local and National Platform and will be acceptable and embraced by youth with T2D as an important component of their management plan. 2. The investigators hypothesize that the additional of traditional medicine elements will increase the acceptability and adherence to DBT for Indigenous children.",
          "detailedDescription": "The investigators will conduct a quasi-experimental trial with a small sample of adolescents and one family member to participate in group-based Dialectical Behavioural Therapy (DBT) or be randomized to a control arm. Pre-measures, post-measures, and 3-month follow up measures will be collected on DBT participants and control participants. Participants receiving DBT and parents/guardian of the DBT participants will also be asked to complete 1-on-1 qualitative interviews after the 16-week program is finished. Pilot 1 will consist of group-based DBT and Pilot 2 will consist of group-based DBT with an optional component which incorporates traditional Indigenous medicines and knowledge. Pilot 2 will be built with Indigenous scholars and elders and will be submitted as an amendment to the University of Manitoba Research Ethics Board when appropriate consultation has been completed. We are only requesting approval for Pilot 1 at this time.\n\nScreening, Enrolment and Intervention Assignment: Research assistants will recruit participants from the Diabetes Education Resource for Children and Adolescents, located in the Community Services Building at the Health Science Center in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Participants currently enrolled in the iCARE Cohort, who have consented to be contacted about future studies and who meet eligibility requirements will also be approached to share information about this study. Interested participants will be screened utilizing a number of questionnaires and self-report measures in person (if allowable), via telephone, or on REDCap\n\nPilot 1 will be completed virtually through Zoom HealthCare.\n\nThe main outcome measures for the pilot trials were selected to inform the feasibility and sample size required for a larger RCT on a national scale. These include recruitment rates, retention rates, adherence to the intervention, retention for follow-up measurements, and satisfaction with the intervention. The investigators will also assess youth and parent experiences and perceptions of the intervention using inductive qualitative research upon completion of the 16-week trial.\n\nThe proposed intervention is mental health support intervention, therefore it does not include medication therapy or devices. The program is being delivered by trained clinical psychologist/psychology students.\n\nDebriefing occurs throughout the intervention to assess for significant mental distress (including but not limited to weekly check-ins). Individual mental health concerns will be dealt with with as they arise. If at any point during the clinical research, clinicians judge the program is no longer beneficial or actively detrimental to an individual's health and wellbeing, the team has the right to end services and provide referrals and support for other treatment models.\n\nAdverse events (AE) will be collected to document unfavorable changes in current health status of the research participant or any incident, experience or outcome that suggests that the research may place participants or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, economic or social harm). The AE's that will be reported will include complications from the blood draw (syncopal episode, infection, excessive bleeding requiring medical attention), or events that could be related to completing the mental health questionnaires (emergency visit or crisis resource utilization or hospitalization for suicidal ideation, attempt). All deaths, regardless of cause will also be recorded for participants active in the study.\n\nSample Size Assessment\n\nSample size analysis showed that a full-scale trial would require 150 subjects (using a standardized effect size of 0.4 scale change in the self reported quality of life for an individual). The investigators chose to use 10% of this for each pilot (n=15) and added a control arm of n=15 for each pilot as well.\n\nQuantitative Analytic Plan\n\nFor feasibility outcomes the investigators will be looking for a minimum 70% adherence (i.e. completing 11/16 sessions) in order to properly test the study hypothesis with a larger trial. A minimum 85% retention rate at follow-up (i.e. percentage of randomized participants that provide outcome measures at follow-up) is needed to protect the original randomization. For estimated effect size of the intervention the investigators will test for group-wise differences in the outcome measures using a repeated measures mixed effects regression model with a random subject effect to account for the within-subject correlations and repeated measures design with outcomes assessed at baseline and 16 weeks. Fixed effects will include treatment, time, and their interaction. An intention to treat strategy will be adopted for the final analysis. The analysis will be underpowered to test for effects for boys and girls separately, however sex as an interaction term in the analysis will be added.\n\nQualitative Analytic Plan\n\nYouth \\& parents/guardian from the DBT intervention arm of both pilot studies (n = 30) will participate in end-point semi-structured interviews of 45-minute duration, guided by Interpretive Description methodology. Interpretive description is a non-categorical applied research approach that seeks to generate understanding of clinically relevant phenomena in relation to its local context. An investigator (M.A) with extensive qualitative research experience will conduct all interviews. Interviews will be conducted via Zoom HealthCare or in-person if allowable. Questions will focus on perceptions of intervention delivery (e.g., duration, dose, timing, interventionist); content (e.g., domains); experiences - including emotional and cognitive responses; and intervention acceptability.\n\nAudio recorded data will be transcribed verbatim and managed using NVivo software (version 1.0). Data from the first three transcripts will inform development of a coding framework which will be applied to subsequent interviews and iteratively revised upon identification of new conceptually distinct codes. Codes will be grouped into thematic clusters with supporting narrative excerpts. Thematic data will be used to refine what the investigators determine as modifiable domains of DBT."

There is a need to develop practical approaches that not only equip people with knowledge about T2DM self-management, but also help them mitigate the adverse social determinants of health (SDOH) that are fueling the burgeoning numbers of people in the United States with T2DM and that are preventing them from practicing healthful behaviors. This study will examine an intervention named 'Disfrutando' that strives to help people prevent and manage T2DM.",
          "detailedDescription": "The investigators have engaged a community-health-academic partnership that is working to move a program of research forward that addresses the 'epidemic' of T2DM in high burden populations in Missouri. The partnership developed the Disfrutando intervention in a non-controlled feasibility study with encouraging results: Hemoglobin A1C (i.e., average blood sugar levels) was lowered for 66% of 31 participants. Disfrutando is an interactive, culturally tailored, bundled intervention that aims to enhance self-efficacy and equip people with knowledge and skills about healthful behaviors (i.e., healthy eating, physical activity) and engage them in primary/diabetes/eye care to enhance diabetes health outcomes. What makes Disfrutando stand out is its facilitation by community health workers who focus on \"meeting people where they are\" and connecting them to no- or low-cost resources that increase access to/engagement in healthy eating, physical activity, and primary/diabetes/eye care. The investigators now propose a 1-year pilot study that will examine the effectiveness of and implementation strategies for Disfrutando using a two-group randomized, wait-list controlled design. Hypotheses are: (1) implementation quality and acceptability of the Disfrutando intervention will be high and (2) the intervention will lower HbA1C, change body weight, enhance self-efficacy, and mitigate adverse SDOH. Research Questions are: RQ1: What is the implementation quality of the intervention? (i.e., adherence to intervention content, characteristics of intervention delivery), RQ2: Are people engaged and satisfied with the intervention?, RQ3: What is the impact of Disfrutando on HbA1C and change in body weight?, and RQ4: What is the relationship between HbA1C, change in body weight and selected mediators (diabetes self-efficacy, quality of intervention delivery, mitigation of SDOH (i.e., access and linkage to resources for engagement in healthy eating, physical activity, and attendance at health care appointments) and moderators (personal and health characteristics)? This pilot project will provide critical effectiveness and implementation data to inform an application for a multi-site community trial. Early identification and management of pre-diabetes and T2DM is critical for the prevention of diabetes-related serious health problems and premature death."

          "detailedDescription": "Cataract remains a leading cause of visual impairment and blindness worldwide, particularly in aging populations. Although several pharmacological approaches have been explored, removal of the lens with phacoemulsification remains the gold standard of treatment. This surgical technique removes the opacified lens while preserving the capsular bag to hold an intraocular lens (IOL).\n\nDespite its overall safety and efficacy, cataract surgery is frequently complicated by posterior capsule opacification (PCO), the most common long-term postoperative issue. PCO leads to secondary visual deterioration and is observed in approximately 20-30% of patients within five years of surgery. The standard treatment for visually significant PCO is neodymium-doped yttrium-aluminium-garnet (Nd:YAG) laser capsulotomy, a rapid and effective outpatient procedure, though not without risks such as increased intraocular pressure, cystoid macular edema, or retinal detachment.\n\nThe pathophysiology of PCO involves residual lens epithelial cells (LECs) proliferating, migrating, and undergoing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), ultimately leading to fibrotic or regenerative capsular changes. Fibrotic variants are characterized by matrix contraction and EMT, while regenerative types manifest as Elschnig pearls.\n\nMultiple risk factors have been associated with PCO, including age, ocular inflammation, and systemic diseases. However, the current evidence remains inconsistent: some studies suggest diabetes may exert a protective effect against PCO, whereas others report an increased risk with longer disease duration. These discrepancies may be due to the lack of subgroup analyses with respect to antidiabetic therapy. In particular, metformin use might act as a protective factor, whereas diabetes without metformin treatment could increase PCO risk. The absence of stratification by medication may thus explain the heterogeneous findings. Beyond PCO, diabetes is linked to multiple ocular comorbidities including retinopathy, ocular surface disease, and a higher overall risk for cataract formation.\n\nMetformin is the most widely prescribed oral antidiabetic drug and exerts pleiotropic effects beyond glucose control. It has demonstrated antifibrotic, antiproliferative, and anti-senescent properties in various tissues. Preclinical studies indicate that metformin suppresses LEC senescence and proliferation, and recent clinical data link metformin use to reduced rates of Nd:YAG laser capsulotomy. In systemic contexts, metformin modulates fibrotic and proliferative responses in hepatic, renal, cardiovascular, and neoplastic tissues primarily via activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), inhibition of mTOR signaling, and reduction of oxidative stress and inflammatory pathways.\n\nWhile metformin has been detected in aqueous humour, its presence and concentration in the human lens capsule remain unknown. Moreover, it is unclear whether intraocular metformin levels are sufficient to affect LEC proliferation-an essential driver of PCO pathogenesis. Previous studies have not established a link between systemic metformin exposure and functional intraocular bioactivity, nor have they used live-cell tracking to directly assess it's effect on LEC behaviour.\n\nIn addition to systemic and pharmacological factors, IOL design also influences PCO development. A sharp square-edge design acts as a mechanical barrier to LEC migration and remains the current standard in PCO prevention. Hydrophobic acrylic materials are associated with lower PCO rates compared to hydrophilic or polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) optics, although none completely prevent it.\n\nTherefore, the aim of the study is to quantify metformin concentrations in serum and lens capsule tissue of type 2 diabetes mellitus patients and to assess the effect of metformin on human LEC proliferation in vitro."

          "briefSummary": "This randomized, double-blind, prospective clinical trial aims to investigate the effect of remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) on myocardial protection in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus undergoing elective coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. Perioperative myocardial injury remains a significant concern during CABG, particularly in high-risk patients such as those with diabetes. RIPC is a low-cost, non-invasive intervention that may reduce myocardial damage by enhancing ischemic tolerance through intermittent limb ischemia.\n\nSixty patients aged 40-85 years with type 2 diabetes scheduled for isolated CABG will be randomized to either receive RIPC or standard care. RIPC will be applied through five cycles of upper limb cuff inflation and deflation prior to sternotomy. High-sensitivity troponin T levels will be measured at 24, 48, and 72 hours postoperatively to assess myocardial injury. Secondary outcomes include acute kidney injury (KDIGO classification), maximum vasoactive-inotropic score (VIS) during the first 72 postoperative hours, ICU and hospital length of stay. This study will provide insight into the cardioprotective role of RIPC in diabetic patients undergoing cardiac surgery."

          "briefSummary": "This is a community-based implementation program consisting of multiple components delivered by a multidisciplinary team to detect and prevent young onset diabetes with precision and value using biogenetic markers, digital tools, integrated care through public private partnership. Adults aged between 18 and 44 (inclusive) without known diabetes and with at least one risk factor for diabetes will undergo a saliva DNA and capillary blood test and complete a questionnaire. Depending on their risk levels, participants will be stratified to high risk and low risk progressors to diabetes. The high risk progressors will undergo annual oral glucose tolerance test to detect diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). All participants will receive a personalized report indicating their genetic and modifiable risk explained by nurses or doctors. All participants will be offered regular access to webinars for education and empowerment for 2 years. The high risk group will additionally receive a 2-year risk-stratified intervention with different combinations of care interventions. These include clinical and laboratory assessment for comprehensive evaluation of cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic risks, medical and nurse consultations, empowerment by health messages, webinars, face-to-face workshops, subsidies for medications and self-monitoring tools (e.g. CGM devices, weighing scale) to motivate behavioural change. The outcomes will be analysed within the REAIM framework (reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation and maintenance), progresssion to prediabetes or diabetes, patient reported outcomes and cost effectiveness.",
          "detailedDescription": "BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE:\n\nIn Hong Kong, 1 in 10 adults have diabetes. In hospital-based clinic setting, 1 in 5 adults with diabetes were diagnosed before the age of 40, i.e. young-onset diabetes (YOD). The latter is the major driver of recurrent hospitalizations, critical illnesses and premature death. Compared to fasting plasma glucose (FPG) or HbA1c, 2-hour PG is needed to detect impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and diabetes (DM). Besides, 2-h PG is more robust than FPG or HbA1c in predicting major events and death. The selection of participants with IGT for intervention is based on the positive effects of lifestyle modification and metformin only in individuals with IGT and not in individuals with isolated IFG in randomized clinical trials. Besides, there is strong familial tendency of YOD and based on our published and in-house 20-year prospective data in a workforce, 80% of people who developed DM came from 20-30% of individuals with high genetic risk unmasked by modifiable risk factors such as obesity and smoking.\n\nIn this implementation project, investigators shall use a 2-stepped approach to identify adults aged between 18 and 44 (inclusive) with genetic predisposition to undergo yearly OGTT to diagnose IGT and diabetes early for intervention. Investigators shall apply the proprietary DForesee (DF) risk algorithm including clinical and biogenetic risk factors to select the top 25% of participants at the highest risk for IGT or diabetes in next 10 years to undergo yearly OGTT accompanied by a risk-based intervention program.\n\nSTUDY DESIGN AND METHODS:\n\nBy using quasi-experimental design based on an evidence-based multi-component strategy, investigators aim to detect and delay the onset of diabetes in adults aged less than 45 years. Investigators aim to identify 9,000 adults aged between 18 and 44 years (inclusive) in community- and clinic settings during a 2-year period, followed by 2 years of risk-stratified intervention. Investigators shall use clinical and biogenetic assessment including DNA testing, capillary blood test and administration of questionnaires to classify participants to high risk and low risk progressors. All participants will receive risk-based intervention. Low risk progressors will receive a personalized report indicating their genetic and modifiable risk explained by nurses and with repeated clinical and biogenetic assessment at year 2. The high risk progressors will additionally undergo annual oral glucose tolerance test to detect diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and will receive a personalized report explained by doctors. All participants will be offered regular access to webinars for education and empowerment for 2 years. The high risk group will additionally receive a 2-year risk-stratified intervention with different combinations of care interventions. These include clinical and laboratory assessment for comprehensive evaluation of cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic risks, medical and nurse consultations, empowerment by health messages, webinars, face-to-face workshops, subsidies for medications and self-monitoring tools (e.g. CGM devices for IGT and DM groups only, weighing scale for all high risk progressors) to motivate behavioural change.\n\nINCLUSION and EXCLUSION CRITERIA Age 18-44 (inclusive) years without known diabetes, at least one risk factor for diabetes and with usual place of residence in Hong Kong, The risk factors for diabetes include central or general obesity, family history of diabetes, smoking history, history of hypertension, high blood glucose level, abnormal lipid level/ vascular disease, or fatty liver, history of gestational diabetes polycystic ovary syndrome or delivery of baby≥ 4kg (for women only), less than 150mins of physical activity every week.\n\nPeople with known diabetes or conditions considered to be unsuitable by the project team including illiteracy will be excluded.\n\nOUTCOME MEASURES The outcomes will be analysed within the REAIM framework (reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation and maintenance), progresssion to prediabetes or diabetes, patient reported outcomes and cost effectiveness."

Each dimension has three levels: no problems, some problems, and extreme problems (labelled 1-3).\n\nThe EQ VAS records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale numbered from 0 to 100. The endpoints are labelled 'The best health you can image' at number 100 and 'The worst health you can image' at number 0. The VAS can be used as a quantitative measure of health outcome that reflects the patient's own judgement.",

          "briefSummary": "Approximately 20% of adults have prediabetes in Germany. Prediabetes is defined as a condition with glucose levels outside the normal range but not yet meeting the criteria for type 2 diabetes. The pathogenesis of prediabetes, as well as of type 2 diabetes, involves whole-body insulin resistance associated with inadequate insulin secretion. These two central processes of glucose regulation are modulated by the brain. The brain communicates via the autonomic nervous system (ANS) with metabolically important organs in the periphery to modulate insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion. These processes are impaired in individuals with prediabetes and diabetes. An ANS sympathovagal imbalance has also been observed in individuals with prediabetes. There are no specific therapeutic approaches to improve ANS sympathovagal imbalance. It is assumed that resonant frequency breathing (RFB) maximizes heart rate variability (HRV) through rhythmization of breathing, heartbeat, and blood pressure. Through this state of coherence, the activity of the parasympathetic nervous system is upregulated, and the activity of the sympathetic nervous system is suppressed, leading to an increase in modulation of ANS activity. Several studies have demonstrated that heart rate variability-biofeedback (HRV-BF) interventions improve HRV, reduce stress and anxiety, and alleviate symptoms in patients with various medical conditions. To the best of current knowledge, no study has investigated the effect of HRV-BF-RFB on glucose metabolism. Therefore, the proposed randomized controlled non-blinded trial aims to gain evidence about the effect of HRV-BF-RFB compared to an anti-stress program on glucose metabolism in individuals with prediabetes. Glucose metabolism is characterized using the 75 g oral glucose tolerance test. There are two potential mechanisms by which HRV-BF-RFB may improve glucose metabolism in individuals with prediabetes: (a) a 0°-phase relationship between heart oscillations and breathing, maximizing the amplitude of respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), and (b) activation of the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway. The investigators hypothesized that in individuals with prediabetes, the HRV-BF-RFB intervention will improve glucose metabolism and glucose variability."

          "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to assess the effectiveness of an intervention that delivers nutrition education based on the Portfolio Diet on type-2 diabetes (T2D) risk factors among adults who are without chronic conditions, who have overweight and a high waist circumference plus one self-reported T2D risk factor. The main questions it aims to answer include:\n\n1. What are the barriers and facilitators for effective implementation of the nutrition education intervention?\n2. What is the effectiveness of the intervention on T2D risk factors?\n3. What are implementation strategies for scaling up the intervention?\n\nParticipants will participate in a 12-month lifestyle intervention comprised of nutrition education based on the Portfolio Diet that includes community gardening sessions. In addition, participants will take part in pre-implementation focus groups/interviews and post-implementation focus groups/interviews.",
          "detailedDescription": "Peel has one of the highest rates of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in Ontario. Individuals with T2D have a higher risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), kidney disease, lower limb amputation and vision loss compared to the general population. Excess body weight, poor diet, and physical inactivity are key contributors to T2D risk, and are influenced by many factors including structural inequities and our built and food environments. Specific contributors in Peel include an urban design that discourages walking and a high proportion of residents with ethnic backgrounds at higher risk for T2D. There is an urgent need for local and practical T2D prevention strategies in Peel to ensure the health and quality of life of its residents. A healthy diet and lifestyle are important factors for preventing chronic diseases such as T2D.\n\nThe Portfolio Diet (PD) is an evidence-based healthy eating plan that has shown clinically meaningful reductions in T2D and CVD risk factors such as cholesterol and blood pressure in randomized controlled trials. Several prospective cohort studies have also shown the positive impact of the PD on the incidence of T2D and CVD. Given the strong scientific evidence, the PD is recommended by Diabetes Canada, the Canadian Cardiovascular Society and Obesity Canada.\n\nAn app for the PD (PortfolioDiet.app) was recently developed by the investigators. However, a strategy to deliver the PD at the community level has yet to be designed and evaluated. An intervention (program) that delivers tailored nutrition education based on the PD has the potential to be a successful strategy to address the T2D burden in Peel. This intervention (program) could help reduce barriers to accessing and understanding nutrition and health information, which are key elements of T2D prevention. A critical step to ensuring the success of such an intervention (program) is engaging with community stakeholders to design an effective implementation strategy.\n\nThe overarching aim of the proposed project is to assess the effectiveness of an intervention (program) that delivers nutrition education based on the PD on T2D risk factors. To achieve this, the investigators have partnered with the Peel Food Action Council (PFAC) and will conduct formative work using Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) to inform the implementation strategy for the intervention (program). The investigators also plan to incorporate community gardening sessions into the intervention led by PFAC to reinforce the nutrition education and enhance participant engagement. Community gardening programs have emerged as a strategy to improve diet quality especially when paired with nutrition education. The research questions pertain to understanding the barriers and facilitators for successful implementation of the intervention (program), evaluating its effectiveness on T2D risk factors and identifying implementation strategies for scaling up.\n\nThe specific aims are:\n\nAim 1: To conduct pre-implementation focus groups and interviews with the target population to inform the design of the intervention and implementation strategy.\n\nAim 1.2: To evaluate the effectiveness of the design of the curriculum and nutrition education modules teaching the Portfolio Diet through questionnaires and small group discussions with adults at risk of T2D (i.e. target population).\n\nAim 2: To assess the effect of the intervention among individuals at risk for T2D on changes in body weight, waist circumference, blood pressure and diet quality after 1 year compared to baseline.\n\nAim 2.1: To assess the effect of the intervention on biomarkers of T2D risk (glucose, insulin, lipids, HbA1c) after 1 year compared to baseline.\n\nAim 3: To conduct post-implementation focus groups and interviews with participants to determine the effectiveness of the intervention implementation and gather insights for scaling up."

In Ophthalmology, AI algorithms are reaching maturity in diagnosis such as diabetic retinopathy and glaucoma. Higher-at-risk subjects of African descent are nevertheless usually under-represented in training datasets and therefore unclear about representativity.\n\nA small scale validation study in consecutive patients in a large Eyesore unit in Mozambique will be performed to determine the diagnostic ability of these AI softwares in this population",
          "detailedDescription": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithm's are the next frontier in medical management, usually meant to improve diagnostic capabilities and to optimize the existing resources. They are particularly relevant in settings where there is a lack of specialised Human Resources such as physicians.\n\nEnsuring these algorithms can be used in a wide population is therefore crucial to clinical implementation. Validation studies in specific segments of populations are needed to ensure all patients are represented and the results are therefore reliable. Higher-at-risk subjects of African descent are nevertheless usually under-represented in training datasets and therefore unclear about representativity.\n\nA pilot study for validation of an AI algorithm for Glaucoma and Diabetic Retinopathy will be done for the MONA G-RISK® and diabetic retinopathy. Consecutive patients from a large Eye Unit in Mozambique's capital will be screened using these AI algorithms and validated using clinical standard as ground truth."

          "detailedDescription": "Background:\n\nHypertension is the predominant risk factor for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) - the leading cause of death worldwide. In 2015, 1 in 5 adult women and close to 1 in 4 adult men had elevated blood pressure. The estimated number of adults with elevated blood pressure increased from 594 million in 1975 to 1.13 billion in 2015, largely due to increases in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).3 Globally, 10.5% adult population has diabetes, with almost half unaware of the condition they are living with. Complications of persistently elevated blood pressure and poor glycemic control, such as heart disease, stroke, chronic kidney disease, blindness, are well documented. Compared with patients with controlled blood pressure, hypertension patients without treatment and those treated but with uncontrolled blood pressure have substantially higher risk of all-cause and CVD mortality. The factors underlying the gaps in hypertension and diabetes care continuum (i.e., screening, diagnosis, treatment, control) are complex and multifactorial, reflecting the vulnerabilities at individual, community, and healthcare system levels in LMICs.Few studies have examined the strategy to address shortage of healthcare human resources and NCD care accessibility through decentralization with task shifting (or task sharing), which has been shown a viable strategy to rapidly scale-up antiretroviral therapy for HIV/AIDS care in resource-limited settings. Like many other LMICs, Bangladesh is experiencing rapid demographic and epidemiologic transitions. In the recent years, NCD replaced infectious disease and maternal and neonatal conditions as the leading cause of death, accounting for 71% of all deaths in Bangladesh. An estimated 27.4% of Bangladeshi adults have hypertension and 9.8% have diabetes. According to 2017-2018 Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey, only 36.7% of Bangladeshi adults with hypertension were aware that they had hypertension, and only 31.1% were on treatment and 12.7% had blood pressure controlled. The awareness, treatment, and control rates for diabetes were estimated to be 30.9%, 28.2%, and 26.5%, respectively. Tobacco use, insufficient fruit/vegetable intake, overweight/obese, are highly prevalent. Over the past decade, the Government of Bangladesh has promoted improved NCD care through national multisectoral actions, most notably through the establishment of dedicated noncommunicable disease facilities (\"NCD Corners\") at subdistrict hospitals since 2011. These NCD Corners were designed to provide preventive and clinical care for common NCDs. Despite the initiative, NCD corners remained nascent due to a lack of specific guidelines, trained workforce, appropriate medicines and supplies, adequate laboratory facilities, and poor record-keeping and reporting.\n\nIn the present study, we aim to document the experience of implementing a multicomponent, decentralized primary care in rural Bangladesh, including components of healthcare provider training, mHealth, decentralization with task shifting, and community-based care, and to generate data on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the multicomponent integrated care as compared to usual care and to mHealth intervention alone.\n\nStudy design\n\nThis is a type 2 effectiveness-implementation hybrid study with a dual focus on testing of effectiveness of interventions and implementation strategies.41 A three-arm mixed-methods quasi-experimental design will be used to achieve the aims specified before. Two intervention subdistricts (i.e., mHealth only and mHealth plus task sharing, decentralization, and community-based care) and one reference subdistrict from Dinajpur district, Rangpur division in Northern Bangladesh (Figure 1) will be selected to implement the study. While the key outcomes will be evaluated with community-based repeated cross-sectional surveys with independent samples, we will also make use of facility-based prospective cohort data to supplement community-based surveys. We will employ a mixed methods approach to generate rich data on changes in primary and secondary outcomes, and quantitative and qualitative data for process evaluation. The project duration is 36 months.\n\nSpecific objectives and hypothesis of the study\n\nSA1: Document the experience of implementing a multicomponent decentralized care in public primary care system for hypertension and diabetes and evaluate the effectiveness of the package compared with usual care and mHealth intervention alone. The findings will not only shed light on the effectiveness of the interventions on treatment outcomes, but will also informing approaches to improve screening, diagnosis, and management of these conditions. Among the first, we expect to provide data on the role of decentralization for expanding NCD care in resource limited settings.\n\nSA2: Investigate the factors that explain how the interventions influences hypertension and diabetes management and explore barriers/facilitators to deliver and sustaining intervention. We will conduct mixed methods research to understand how the intervention influences treatment and prevention in this patient population. Particularly, we will assess changes in lifestyle (i.e., smoking, dietary salt intake, physical activity, alcohol consumption), burden for patients (e.g., waiting time, travel-related cost) at individual and community level. Qualitative data will shed light on facilitators and barriers to hypertension and diabetes prevention and control from perspectives of patients (and their families), primary care providers, and public health officials, and other stakeholders.\n\nSA3: Undertake a health economic evaluation of the interventions for primary care systems. A comprehensive evaluation of cost and effectiveness will be important for the models tested, providing necessary evidence for policy makes and stakeholders to scale up the interventions.\n\nWe hypothesize that compared with usual care, the multicomponent decentralized primary care will improve all steps along the hypertension and diabetes care continuum. On the other hand, we hypothesize that the mHealth intervention alone (Simple App) may improve BP and glycemic control compared with usual care but will have limited impact on rates of screening, diagnosis, and treatment. We also hypothesize that the multicomponent integrated care will lead to higher treatment success rate relative to mHealth intervention alone.\n\nStudy population and settings:\n\nIn rural Bangladesh, a subdistrict (Upazila) is the second lowest tier of administration, while union is the lowest rural administrative unit, and each union is made up of nine wards (usually one village is designated as a ward). The primary healthcare system in rural areas consist of a subdistrict level hospital (Upazila Health Complexes), union health (sub)centers, and community clinics which cover 2 to 4 villages. A Upazila Health Complex lies at the top of the primary care system. It is typically a 50-bed hospital, serving a population of a few hundred thousand.\n\nCommunity clinics are at the lowest level of the healthcare facility hierarchy. With two rooms and drinking-water and lavatory facilities under a covered waiting area, community clinics were designed to be accessible for more than 80% of rural population within less than 30-minute walking distance.42 Community clinics are staffed by a Community Health Care Provider (CHCP), who usually receive 4-month medical training.\n\nInterventions\n\nBuilt upon assessment of barriers to hypertension and diabetes management at patient, provider, and health system levels and previous interventional studies, a multicomponent intervention package was designed to increase access to primary care, and to improve care quality and patient retention. The intervention package includes mHealth, decentralization with task sharing, community-based care, and supportive monitoring visits. The effectiveness of the intervention package is compared with mHealth only intervention and usual care.\n\nDescription of the interventions Multicomponent decentralized care\n\nIt will include both government model and mHealth for patient management and some other components like supportive supervisions. In line with Bangladesh government's recommendation, Simple App will be used by primary care facilities for coordinated NCD management. The Simple App was developed and is actively maintained by Resolve to Save Lives (more details about the app can be found from the website https://www.simple.org). The app was designed to tackle two major factors contribute to blood pressure and glycemic control among treated patients with hypertension and diabetes, namely timely titration and adherence with therapy. To accommodate the context of busy primary care facilities, data collection is limited to a few key variables such as prescription, follow-up visit, and changes in blood pressure and blood glucose. Using unique patient ID, the app allows seamless transferring of electronic health records among primary care facilities and thus ensure continuity of the process.\n\nEngaging community health workers in NCD care: Integrating hypertension and diabetes care into the community by training CHWs to provide screening, counselling, and follow-up has been shown to improve hypertension and diabetes care management in many LMICs, including countries from South Asia. In line with previous studies, we will enlist CHWs in case finding, counselling, referral, and follow-up. Existing CHWs will be trained and provided with necessary equipment and health education materials and tools to carry out these tasks. Initial training will cover topics including basics of hypertension and diabetes, lifestyle risk factors counselling, patient self-management, and collaboration with CHCPs. A refresher training will be done at 6 months of implementation. CHWs will not be compensated for the activities performed to be consistent with Bangladesh government's plan considering scalability.\n\nSupportive monitoring and supervision: Quarterly supervision by higher level health administrators and medical professionals will be organized to NCD corner to help solve issues with patient managements, medication supply etc. Visits may be informed by performance summary made available by Simple App dashboard. Similarly, quarterly supervision to CCs by NCD corner medical staff and subdistrict health officials will be done. Supportive visits by study team will be organized to help NCD corners and CCs solve technical issues with Simple App.\n\nmHealth only\n\nIn subdistrict with mHealth intervention only, training and support to use Simple App for hypertension and diabetes management will be provided. The healthcare providers at NCD corner will decide how they react to the information made available by the digital tool, and similarly the patient component will not be included. Patient pathways remain the same as usual care.\n\nUsual care\n\nExisting usual care provided by government primary care system including screening, treatment initiating, drug refill, and routine follow-up, at subdistrict NCD corner. Community clinics and CHWs have less involvement in NCD care provision."

It provides researchers with a centralized, international patient registry for all rare diseases. This program allows patients and researchers to connect as easily as possible to help advance treatments and cures for rare diseases. The CoRDS team works with patient advocacy groups, individuals and researchers to help in the advancement of research in over 7,000 rare diseases. The registry is free for patients to enroll and researchers to access. Visit sanfordresearch.org/CoRDS to enroll.",
          "detailedDescription": "CoRDS collects contact, sociodemographic and health information about participants. This information is entered into CoRDS and linked to a unique coded identifier. Below are some examples of information requested on the Questionnaire that will be entered into CoRDS:\n\n* Contact information: Name, Mailing Address, Phone Number, Email Address\n* Sociodemographic information: Date of Birth, Place of Birth, Sex, Gender, Ethnicity\n* Health information: Family History, Information related to Diagnosis\n\nDe-identified information in CoRDS will be made available to researchers, if they have obtained approval for their research project from (1) the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at the researcher's institution and (2) a panel of experts.\n\nA subset of de-identified information collected from each profile may be shared with certain other databases. This is done in order to help improve understanding of rare diseases, to avoid the duplication of efforts and to collaborate with existing research efforts with organizations dedicated to rare diseases.\n\nParticipants may elect to have their information shared with patient advocacy groups (PAGs) representing individuals with rare or uncommon diseases who have partnered with CoRDS. The PAG will sign an agreement stating that they will not use the information for Research purposes. CoRDS personnel will not be held responsible for the use of information by the PAG.\n\nThe CoRDS Registry will not be paid by Researchers, Other Patient Registries or Patient Advocacy Groups (PAGs) for access to information in CoRDS.\n\nIf a parent/LAR consents on behalf of a minor, CoRDS will contact the participant when he or she reaches the age of 18 in order to obtain consent. If this consent is not obtained in a timely manner, the participant will be withdrawn from CoRDS.\n\nCoRDS contacts participants annually to confirm continued interest in participation in CoRDS, and to request that participants update the information they have provided."

          "briefSummary": "Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) is a common complication of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. DPN is characterized by significant axonal degeneration and segmental demyelination affecting sensory and motor nerves. The effect of foot sole sensation on gait and balance parameters has been reported in various studies in the literature, however, no study has been found examining the effect of foot sensory training on plantar sensation, functional performance, balance, gait and kinesiophobia in type 2 diabetic individuals with neuropathy. In order to contribute to the literature, 40 type 2 diabetic individuals with neuropathy who applied to the Turgut Ozal Medical Center Endocrinology and Metabolic Diseases Polyclinic will be included in this randomized controlled study. After diabetic foot training is given to all participants, an experimental (20) and a control (20) group will be formed with a sequential random method. Foot sensory training will be given to the experimental group, while no intervention will be made to the control group, and sensory training will be given to the participants who wish after the study is completed. All participants will be evaluated for subscapular sense, functional performance, balance, walking and kinesiophobia at the beginning and end of the training. Subscapular sense will be evaluated with light touch, two-point discrimination and vibration tests. Functional performance evaluation will be made with timed up and go test and timed stair ascent-descend test. Kinesiophobia will be analyzed with Tampa Kinesiophobia Scale, Balance; One-Legged Stand Test and Y balance tests and walking will be analyzed with Kinect V2 camera based software. Physical activity levels will be evaluated with International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form. The data taken into the research will be analyzed with SPSS (Statistical Program in Social Sciences) program. The values belonging to the data will be expressed with percentage, mean and standard deviation, and the significance level (p) will be taken as 0.05 for comparison tests.",
          "detailedDescription": "Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a chronic metabolic disease that develops as a result of insufficiency of insulin itself or its action. Diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN), a common complication of type 2 diabetes, results from metabolic and microvascular changes as a consequence of prolonged hyperglycemia and metabolic derangements.\n\nDiabetic peripheral neuropathy is associated with damage to small unmyelinated and myelinated nerve fibers, resulting in impaired sensations of touch, pain and temperature. Damage to large myelinated nerve fibers results in decreased sensation of vibration and proprioception. Sole sensation is an important parameter for posture and gait control. When the afferent inputs of the foot are not properly transmitted to the central nervous system, a lack of balance develops reciprocally.\n\nFunctional performance refers to some activities and behaviors in daily life that individuals can perform up to a certain level. In individuals with diabetes mellitus with neuropathy, it is reported that there are decreases in functional performance as well as strength losses and decreases in joint mobility, especially in the dorsal and plantar foot muscles.\n\nInvolving both sensory and motor fibers, DPN causes balance and gait disturbances and neuropathic pain. As a result of altered gait biomechanics and balance disorders, individuals with diabetes have an increased risk of falling, perception of imbalance and fear of falling. This leads to physical inactivity and loss of muscle strength. It leads to further impairment of gait and balance biomechanics.\n\nKinesiophobia is the patient's fear of physical movement as well as negative cognitive and emotional response to anticipated or actual pain. It is expressed as a condition describing actions resulting from a feeling of vulnerability to re-injury. Impaired balance and fear of falling initiate kinesiophobia in people. As a result, restriction in physical activities increases. The number of studies examining kinesiophobia in individuals with diabetes is very limited. In one study, it was stated that individuals with diabetic neuropathy had an increase in kinesiophobia in balance disorders.\n\nWhen the studies conducted with type 2 diabetic individuals with neuropathy were examined in the literature, no study providing foot sensory training was found. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of foot sensory training on underfoot sensation, functional performance, balance, gait and kinesiophobia in type 2 diabetic individuals with neuropathy. This study will provide data and contribution to fill this gap in the literature."

          "briefSummary": "In this study, the investigators will be looking at results of tests of memory and thinking and daily activities in a group of people without known chronic kidney disease (CKD) , and a group of CKD patients, and follow the participants for up to four more years, including after the participants start dialysis or receive a transplant. The investigators are doing this study to compare how often memory loss, confusion and difficulty with daily activities occur in those without and those with CKD. Additionally, the investigators are doing this study to identify risk factors for memory and thinking problems in CKD patients. The information received through the NDI will be utilized to help track our study population and help provide useful information regarding cause of death of those in our study.",
          "detailedDescription": "Cognitive impairment (CI) in patients with pre-dialysis chronic kidney disease (CKD) is common, affecting more than five million older people with moderate to severe CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate-eGFR \\< 45). Both lower eGFR and increased albuminuria, a marker of systemic vascular endothelial function, are associated with increased dementia risk and structural MRI changes. Stroke prevalence is four times higher in advanced CKD than in non-CKD, and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume and cerebral atrophy are increased. Yet, the natural history, contributing factors, and brain abnormalities associated with cognitive decline in CKD are poorly understood. In addition, previous studies of CI in CKDthe investigators such as ADNI primarily included patients with mild CKD and lower risk of CI, and few have included longitudinal measures of CI. To fill these gaps, our multidisciplinary team (geriatrics, neurology, nephrology, neuroimaging) initiated the longitudinal BRain IN Kidney (BRINK) disease study. The investigators assembled a unique cohort of 433 CKD patients (\\~20% mild-moderate; 35% advanced; 45% severe; eGFR \\< 30), with mean eGFR of 34, and 141 non-CKD (eGFR ≥ 60) controls, followed the participants for a median of 2.5 years, and obtained baseline brain MRI, serial cognitive testing, and serum and urine biomarkers. Our primary goal is to extend BRINK and obtain three and five year brain MRIs to characterize cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease and cerebrovascular-related MRI brain changes over five years. The investigators propose that CKD and its brain sequelae represent a model of accelerated cerebrovascular disease and brain aging, with high rates of hypertension (\\> 90%), diabetes (50%), inflammation, and oxidative stress-all factors known to contribute to both vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease-driving parallel trajectories of microvascular endothelial dysfunction in the kidney and brain and secondary neurodegeneration. Our preliminary data demonstrate that at baseline those with eGFR \\< 30 compared to eGFR ≥ 30 were almost twice as likely to have moderate-severe CI, and delayed memory was most affected, as seen in Alzheimer's disease. On brain MRI, the participants also had more strokes, WMH, and worse white matter integrity. In addition, the investigators found that the common CKD-related factors of elevated serum phosphorus and low hemoglobin were associated with worse cognitive function and more severe abnormalities on brain MRI. Our cross-sectional MRI findings support a cerebrovascular basis for CI in CKD, accelerated by CKD-related factors, together driving neurodegenerative changes that may serve as a proximate correlate of CI in CKD. Driven by our initial findings, the investigators seek to extend BRINK to define the relation between CKD severity and worsening MRI changes and cognitive decline, and the relation between the two. In addition, as the COVID pandemic has accelerated within the US with associated cerebrovascular, cognitive and CKD outcomes, the investigators will leverage this period to examine the effects of COVID diagnosis, symptoms and outcomes on cognitive decline and CKD progression. The investigators will measure these associations using a new COVID survey modeled after the COVID Symptom Tracker from Harvard. Specifically, the investigators propose the following longitudinal aims:\n\nSPECIFIC AIMS (Note: all models will be adjusted for time-varying and time-invariant covariates) Aim 1 (total cohort): Characterize longitudinal changes in level of global cognitive function and cognitive domains over a mean of five years by eGFR level and examine COVID - 19 exposure as potential interaction.\n\nHypotheses 1: Those with eGFR \\< 30 will be at greater risk of developing moderate/severe CI and decline in cognitive domain scores.\n\nAim 1a (CKD only): Estimate the associations between change in CKD-related factors and change in cognitive function in CKD over a mean of five years. Hypothesis 1a: Worsening CKD-related factors will be significantly associated with decline in global cognition and decline in cognitive domain scores.\n\nHypothesis 1b: COVID-19 exposure may modify and accelerate the relation between CKD progression and cognitive decline.\n\nAim 2 (MRI cohort): Determine the rate of cortical thinning, accumulation of WMHs, infarcts, change in WM integrity, and perfusion by eGFR levels over a mean of five years. Hypothesis 2: Frontotemporal cortical thinning (atrophy), increased cortical infarcts and WMH volume, and especially decreased global white matter integrity will progress more quickly with lower eGFR level.\n\nAim 2a (MRI cohort): Estimate the associations between CKD-related factors and structural and functional MRI changes over a mean of five years. Hypothesis 2a: Low hemoglobin and higher albuminuria will be associated with increased cortical thinning and decreased white matter integrity, and higher phosphorus with increased infarcts.\n\nAim 3 (MRI cohort): Measure the association between changes in structural and functional MRI and cognitive decline over a mean of five years. Hypothesis 3: Cortical thinning, increased WMH, infarcts, and worsening WM integrity and will be associated with decline in global cognition and cognitive domain scores.\n\nThis study is innovative by: a) mapping the longitudinal trajectories of imaging to longitudinal cognitive trajectories to measure the impact of CKD on brain changes, b) including the entire range of CKD enriched with advanced CKD, and c) applying a multidisciplinary approach. Our work is significant because it will inform the natural history of cognitive decline and associated brain pathology in CKD and their contributors. It will have impact by 1) identifying CKD patients at greatest risk for CI to alert clinicians, and the timing of potential interventions, 2) measuring the effect of high phosphorus and anemia on cognitive decline and brain changes, and 3) characterizing vascular and Alzheimer's disease brain changes in CKD.\n\nMETHODS Study Population Approximately 225 remaining BRINK CKD participants (eGFR \\< 60; mean eGFR 34) using the CKD-EPI creatinine equation) and 100 age and race matched non-CKD patients with Stages 3-5 CKD (ages 50 and older will be followed in-person, by telephone, or by medical records at the following locations: Hennepin Healthcare clinics, HealthPartners clinics, the University of Minnesota - Fairview Clinics, and/or the Minneapolis Veterans Affairs Medical Center (MVAMC).\n\nStudy Measures\n\n1. A screening interview will be conducted via telephone to determine eligibility (using criteria listed below) to continue to participate in BRINK 2.0 when scheduling the first visit.\n2. All BRINK 2.0 participants will continue to be classified as CKD (GFR \\< 60 ml/min/1.73m2) or non- CKD controls (eGFR ≥ 60 ± 5 ml/min/1.73 m2) based on their initial classification at their baseline visit.\n3. At the initial and three subsequent annual face-to-face visits, the medical history interview and questionnaires, cognitive testing, and physical function assessment will take approximately 75-90 minutes.\n4. If the participant scores \\< 78 on 3MSE or \\< 18 on MOCA, an informant interview is triggered either in-person or by telephone to assess the participant's risk of MCI or dementia. The informant interview will be conducted with the Functional Assessment Questionnaire (FAQ) instrument. If no informant is available, conduct the UPSA performance-based assessment with the participant at the same time as current visit.\n5. A structured telephone interview will be conducted at intervening six months with brief questionnaires.\n6. If the participant has missed their last annual visit, the participant will be scheduled for a face-to-face visit at six months ± two months from their last scheduled annual visit with cognitive battery two (from previous six month visits, and using MOCA instead of 3MS).\n7. If a participant is unable to attend an annual face to face visit, the TICS cognitive phone test will be conducted within ± 2 months instead of their scheduled face-to-face annual visit.\n8. If the participant initiates any modality of dialysis, or undergoes renal transplant, a follow-up visit will be scheduled as soon as possible. The participant will then continue to be seen at six month intervals from the initial post dialysis visit. For the dialysis or transplant patients, at 6, 18, and 30 month follow-up visits, a person identified as the participant's informant will be interviewed with the ADCS- IADL to assess the participant's functional status and dementia status.\n9. For the subset of non-dialysis / transplant subjects who received a baseline MRI, a three year and five year follow-up MRI will be obtained if still within their three month window from previous respective annual visit. If a participant has missed their 3 year and/or 5 year MRI, additional MRIs should be obtained following their 4th, 6th, 7th, or 8th year visit in order to obtain a total of a maximum of three MRIs. Follow up MRIs need to be completed with a two year gap in-between each MRI.\n10. An MRI will also be obtained within 90 days after dialysis initiation and then at 1 year and annually thereafter for a maximum of 5 MRI's after dialysis initiation, each with a 90 day window from their in person visit..\n11. Laboratory measures: renal panel (sodium, potassium, chloride, carbon dioxide, anion gap, albumin, calcium, creatinine, phosphorus, glucose, blood urea nitrogen, eGFR), hemoglobin, hemoglobin A1c, urine albumin, urine microalbumin/creatinine ratio, creatinine, and lipid panel will be collected at baseline and annually.\n12. Research biomarker labs: serum and plasma for cystatin C, IL-6 in serum, IL-6 in urine, TNFα receptor-1, 8-isoprostane, parathyroid hormone, 25-OH vitamin D, advanced glycation end products, clusterin, asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA). were obtained at baseline BRINK 1 visit, and at the 3 year annual visit, or if missed then, at the next in- person BRINK 2 visit. If research labs are unable to be obtained during the first BRINK 2.0 in person visit, the sample will be collected at the next annual in person visit."

          "briefSummary": "Despite many advances in our understanding of the natural history and progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and cardio vascular disease (CVD) in the parent CRIC study over the past 15 years, important questions about key risk factors for these diseases remain unanswered in the AI population. To address this burden of CKD in AI communities Investigators formed a consortium of investigators with extensive experience in conducting research of chronic diseases including diabetes, cardiovascular and kidney disease in AIs of Southwestern US. The proposed CRIC ancillary cohort study of 500 AIs (AI-CRIC) will rapidly improve our understanding of both potential risk factors for CKD progression, as well as the scope of this disease among AIs. This study leverages the current CRIC study and incorporates the planned activities of the next phase of the study - \"CRIC 2018\" - by implementing contemporary CRIC protocols for kidney and cardiovascular measurement and outcomes.",
          "detailedDescription": "Investigators will conduct a longitudinal study of a CKD cohort of Southwest AIs to identify unique risk factors for CKD and CVD progression and compare CKD and CVD event rates and risk factors between AI and the populations represented in CRIC. Investigators will establish a specimen bank to support future ancillary studies designed to identify and examine biomarkers associated with the progression of CKD in AIs.\n\nAt the Clinic Visit the following will occur:\n\n* weight is measured\n* blood pressure and heart rate are recorded\n* information about medical history and medication used recently\n* blood draw (about ½ cup) for the following tests: CBC (Complete Blood Count), tests of metabolism, and several other heart and kidney tests\n* blood pressure in the leg and arm calculated as the Ankle Brachial Index (ABI)\n* urine sample collection for kidney function testing\n* complete questionnaires about quality of life, diet, mood, thought processes and physical activity.\n\nThis visit takes about 1 to 2 hours. Participants will be contacted by telephone six months after the Baseline Visit to ask about recent medical events and medications.\n\nParticipants will be asked to return to the center for annual visits during which many but not all of the procedures described above will be conducted.\n\nAdditionally, participants will be asked to participate in one of two substudies using remote data collection techniques to identify trajectories of kidney function and cardiovascular risk sub-phenotypes"

          "detailedDescription": "A parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study will rigorously test effects of semaglutide on the kidney. Real-time continuous glucose monitoring will be used to control glycemia during study run-in (prior to randomization) and during active therapy, which investigators anticipate will lead to similar glycemic control according to treatment assignment and ability to assess effects independent of glycemia. The trial duration is 26 weeks, a period of time sufficient to gradually titrate study medications to maximum target dose (over 12 weeks) and then observe the full short-term effect of semaglutide on the kidney.\n\nStudy Aims and Hypotheses:\n\nAim 1: Determine the effects of semaglutide vs. placebo on kidney oxygenation in type 1 diabetes. Hypothesis 1: Semaglutide will improve kidney oxygen availability in adults with type 1 diabetes.\n\nAim 2: Determine the effects of semaglutide vs. placebo on urine albumin-creatinine ratio and estimated glomerular filtration rate in type 1 diabetes. Hypothesis 2: Semaglutide will lower albuminuria and slow estimated glomerular filtration rate decline in adults with type 1 diabetes.\n\nAim 3: Determine the glycemic effects and safety of semaglutide vs. placebo in type 1 diabetes. Hypothesis 3: Semaglutide will reduce total daily insulin dose and improve glycemic variability without increasing risk of severe hypoglycemia or diabetic ketoacidosis in adults with type 1 diabetes."

          "detailedDescription": "This will be a single-dose study, in normal participants and in those with current retinal pathology, investigating feasibility of the investigational dye, MB-102, for use in fluorescent angiography compared to fluorescein sodium. Safety and tolerability of MB-102 will also be evaluated. Control dye fluorescein sodium will be administered intravenously a minimum of 3 days prior to MB-102 dosing. After IV administration of dyes, images will be acquired of both eyes with a Zeiss fundus camera (and for some participants additional fundus photography will be performed with clinically-approved ocular angiography imaging systems) by a trained ophthalmic photographer. Participants will return for a follow-up visit after MB-102 dosing for further physical examination, clinical laboratory tests, and reporting of any adverse events. Photographs will be examined for quality as well as the utility of the angiography in evaluating disease diagnosis and progression."

          "detailedDescription": "Time-restricted feeding (TRF) has recently gained popularity as a means of reducing body weight and improving glycemia. A recent clinical trial in men who had prediabetes showed that TRF for five weeks significantly reduced fasting insulin concentration and improved the derived oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT) indexes of beta-cell responsiveness and insulin resistance. However, the effects of TRF have not been studied in patients with poorly controlled Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In this 3-week interventional self-controlled clinical trial, the investigators hypothesize that TRF in patients with poorly-controlled T2DM can improve their mean glucose with the same dose/reduced dose of antidiabetics. Potential study subjects will be identified from Endocrinology clinic patients with a diagnosis of poorly controlled type 2 DM (A1c \\>= 8.0 in the 3 months before enrollment) based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. All study subjects will be in the ad libitum feeding phase for one week, and then will be placed on time-restricted fasting (feeding between 4 AM - 4 PM, fasting in the rest of the day) for the second week. For the third and final week, patients will be returned to the ad libitum feeding phase. The first and third weeks will serve as the control phases, and the second week will be the experimental phase. The mean glucose, serum triglyceride levels, insulin resistance, and body weights will be compared between the two phases. Results of this clinical study may demonstrate a low-cost and practical way of diabetic control."

Impaired muscle mitochondrial metabolism underlies poor physical endurance increasing the risk of mobility disability. The proposed project will use precise in vivo tools to study the pathophysiology of poor physical endurance in a clinical trial treating metabolic acidosis among persons living with chronic kidney disease.",
          "detailedDescription": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is highly prevalent affecting 14% of the U.S. population leading to substantial morbidity and reduced quality of life. Older adults with CKD identify maintenance of functional independence as their top priority. Skeletal muscle health is critical for mobility and an underrecognized target of metabolic acidosis (MA) and protein energy wasting in CKD. Skeletal muscle endurance provides a window into muscle metabolic health and muscle quality. Muscle mitochondrial metabolism is central to muscle and walking endurance providing energy from carbohydrates and fats to power repeated muscle contraction. Investigators showed metabolic acidosis and muscle adiposity as the major determinants of muscle mitochondrial function.\n\nMetabolic acidosis (MA) is long believed to be the main mechanism leading to skeletal muscle wasting and peripheral insulin resistance in CKD. Skeletal muscle mitochondrial metabolism is considered a principal determinant of peripheral insulin sensitivity and muscle quality, but little is known of the impact of MA on muscle mitochondrial function. Muscle mitochondrial dysfunction leads to defective lipid metabolism augmenting adiposity and lipotoxic intermediates resulting in insulin resistance, low endurance, and muscle atrophy. Using in vivo 31Phosphorus Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (31P MRS) investigators showed that the presence and severity of CKD is strongly associated with impaired muscle mitochondrial capacity to generate ATP translating into poor walking endurance. Investigators also showed MA and muscle adiposity are the major determinants of muscle mitochondrial function. Despite the importance of mitochondrial function to muscle health, it is unknown if treatment of MA benefits muscle mitochondrial function, adiposity or endurance in CKD.\n\nThe proposed project will use precise, in vivo 31P MRS and gold-standard testing of peripheral insulin sensitivity by hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp to probe the pathophysiology of MA and low endurance in a clinical trial of alkali therapy in CKD and MA. We will compare sodium bicarbonate to placebo in a multicenter randomized, cross-over trial design in 80 persons with moderate-severe CKD and MA. First, the efficacy of 4-months of alkali therapy will be tested comparing sodium bicarbonate versus placebo on muscle metabolic health in a randomized crossover trial in MA. Second, we will test the efficacy of 4-months of alkali therapy comparing sodium bicarbonate versus placebo on improving physical endurance in MA. The rationale is that identification of therapeutic targets for low physical endurance will inform the development of pharmacologic interventions. Long term, it is expected that strategies treating MA will improve exercise tolerance enabling effective engagement in lifestyle interventions improving quality of life in CKD."

After one minute of basal resting measurements, patients will be asked to perform two knee extensions every second against ankle weights 5-10% of the maximal voluntary contraction. The exercise protocol will last 60-90 seconds (a total of 60 knee extensions) followed by 6 minutes of rest. The intensity of the exercise decreases phosphocreatine (PCr) levels with minimal change in muscle pH. Spectra analysis was performed with AMARES from the jMRUI software package. Spectra are used to calculate the relative concentrations of inorganic phosphate (Pi), PCr, and ATP. PCr recovery will be measured through 6min of rest and fit with a monoexponential equation.",

          "detailedDescription": "The overall description of the Steno-2 Study is stated in four protocols approved by the regulatory authorities in Denmark. The protocol identification numbers are KA 92071gm (4 years intervention ), KA-99035g (8 years intervention ), KA-99035-GS (13 years follow-up since intervention start) and H-KA-99035-GS (21 year follow-up since intervention start).\n\nThe aim of the study was to determine whether intensified multifactorial intervention comprising both behaviour modification and polypharmacy can reduce the risk for late diabetic complications compared to standard treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes and microalbuminuria. The primary end point after four years of intervention was to progression to diabetic nephropathy with other microvascular complications as secondary end points. The primary end point after eight years of intervention was a composite CVD endpoint with microvascular complications as secondary end points.\n\nThe interventional part of the study was ended in December 2001 after a total of eight years of intervention. From that time on, all patients were followed in a post-trial study. Also, during post-trial period all patients in both original treatment arms received similar treatment resembling the treatment given in the original intensive arm of the study. The aim of the post-trial follow-up was to investigate the effect of intensified multifactorial intervention on i) mortality and ii) years of life gained, respectively, with such an interventional approach.\n\nEndpoints in the two parts of the post-trial follow-up:\n\nPart one at 13 years since start of intervention:\n\nPrimary endpoint: Total mortality. Secondary endpoints: Cardiovascular endpoints as defined previously; Microvascular disease.\n\nPart two at 21 years since start of intervention:\n\nPrimary endpoint: Difference in median time to 50% mortality in each of the two original treatment groups Secondary endpoints: Cardiovascular endpoints as defined previously; Recurrent cardiovascular events; Microvascular disease."

          "briefSummary": "To evaluate the efficacy of combination of vitamin B and alpha lipoic acid formulations for the treatment of diabetic polyneuropathy in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus.\n\nMethodology :\n\nThis is a single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial study.\n\nStudy duration May 2024 - September 2025\n\nStudy location :\n\nThis study will be conducted at the Klinik Rawatan Keluarga and diabetes clinic Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia.\n\nSource Reference :\n\nPeople with type 2 diabetes mellitus attending the Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia.\n\nStudy source population :\n\nPeople with type 2 diabetes mellitus attended Klinik Rawatan Keluarga and diabetes clinic Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia during the study period.",
          "detailedDescription": "General objective\n\nTo determine the effectiveness of a fixed dose combination of alpha lipoic acid and vitamin B preparations in comparison with incative drug for treatment of diabetic polyneuropathy (DPN) in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus.\n\nResearch hypothesis\n\n1. There are significant improvements in mean total symptom score (TSS) and neuropathic symptoms score (NSS) in people with diabetic polyneuropathy taking a fixed dose combination of alpha lipoic acid and vitamin B preparations as compared to diabetic polyneuropathy patients taking a placebo.\n2. There are significant improvements in total symptom score (TSS) and neuropathic symptoms score (NSS) among people with diabetic polyneuropathy taking a fixed dose combination of alpha lipoic acid and vitamin B preparations for 12 weeks.\n3. There are significant improvements in fasting plasma glucose, HbA1C level, fasting lipid profile, body mass index (BMI), and diabetes quality of life in people with diabetes taking a fixed dose combination of alpha lipoic acid and vitamin B preparations as compared to diabetic patients taking placebo.\n4. There are no significant differences in the safety parameters of renal function and liver function tests among people with diabetic polyneuropathy at baseline and 12 weeks after taking a fixed dose combination of alpha lipoic acid and vitamin B preparations.\n5. There are significant improvements in fasting plasma glucose, HbA1C level, fasting lipid profile, body mass index (BMI), and diabetes quality of life among diabetic patients taking a fixed dose combination of alpha lipoic acid and vitamin B preparations for 12 weeks.\n\nMethod of data collection\n\nThis study will be conducted after obtaining approval from the Universiti Sains Malaysia Ethical Committee (JPeM) and will be conducted in accordance to World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects.\n\nRecruitment of subject\n\nParticipants will be recruited from Klinik Rawatan Keluarga and diabetes clinic Hospital USM via convenience sampling. Potential participants will be identified from the case notes of patients. Then, the participants will be approached individually. Those who are willing to participate in this study will be given information regarding the study. The participants will be screened to determine their eligibility criteria, including performing neurological symptom score (NSS) and neuropathy disability score (NDS) to determine diabetes polyneuropathy diagnosis. If all the inclusion and exclusion criteria are fulfilled, informed consent will be obtained from all patients who agree to participate in this study. The consent will be obtained by a study team that recruited the patient. Upon consented, the participant's socio-demographic data will be collected, and the medical record will be assessed to fill in their medical and diabetes profiles. They will also answer the total symptoms score (TSS), and revised version of the Diabetes Quality of Life (Rv-DQoL) questionnaire. The physical examination includes measurement of height, weight, calculated Body Mass Index (BMI), and blood pressure during sitting will be done. Then 6ml of fasting venous blood will be taken for measurement of HbA1c, fasting blood glucose, renal function test, liver function test and fasting lipid profile as baseline. All participants were advised not to consume any special supplement or other replacement meal throughout the study.\n\nThe participants then will be randomized to either intervention or control group. The intervention group will receive a fixed dose combination of alpha lipoic acid and vitamin B preparations, and the control group will receive a placebo (look-alike substance that contains no drug).\n\nThe participants will be seen 6 weeks after taking the product. During this visit, they will be assessed for any side effects or adverse events and compliance with the product supplied (compliance form). The total symptoms score (TSS), neurological symptom score (NSS), a revised version of Diabetes Quality of Life (Rv-DQoL), blood pressure, weight, height, calculated Body Mass Index (BMI) will also be measured. Another 6-week supply of the product will be given.\n\nLastly, the participants will be assessed in week 12. During this visit, the same measurement will be taken as visit 1, including answering the questionnaires. Adverse events, blood taking, and compliance will also be assessed.\n\nThe duration for visit 1 and visit 3 (at 12 weeks) is about 50-60 minutes for each visit since it will involve blood taking procedure. Duration for visit 2 (at 6 weeks) is about 30 minutes since it will not involve blood taking.\n\nIntervention group: Fixed dose combination of alpha lipoic acid and vitamin B preparations\n\nAt baseline, the intervention group will receive a fixed dose combination of alpha lipoic acid and vitamin B preparations. This product is packaged and manufactured by BREGO Life Sciences Sdn Bhd company with a brand name of Bionerv®. BIONERV® is the first combination of alpha lipoic acid 300mg and vitamin B complex. Bionerv® is in oral film-coated, orange colour, oblong shape and no marking and embossing on the tablet. Each tablet contains 4 active ingredients as follows: Alpha lipoic acid 300mg, Vitamin B12 (methylcobalamin) 500mcg, Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) 8mg, Vitamin B1 (thiamine) 39mg. All the above ingredients are synthetic. The shelf-life is 2 years. Storage condition is keeping in dry place below 300oC and protecting from light and moisture. It has no bovine-gelatin capsule. There are no precautions on drug-drug interaction, but it is not suitable for children (\\<18 years). There is insufficient reliable data for pregnancy and breast feeding. One bottle consists of 60 tablets.\n\nThis medication needs to take 2 tablets a day after a meal and need to drink more water. In this study, the participants need to take 2 tablets once daily after breakfast. The duration of the intervention will be 12 weeks. All participants are required to return to the clinic in the 6th and 12th week for a post-intervention assessment.\n\nControl group\n\nAt baseline, the control group will receive a placebo drug consisting of Croscamellose Sodium, Microcrystalline Cellulose, Silicon Dioxide and Magnesium stearate. The placebo was manufactured by Yanling Natural Hygiene Sdn Bhd. The formulation of the placebo tablet is derived from the excipients used in the Bionerv tablet.\n\nThe participants need to take 2 tablets once daily after breakfast. The placebo drugs will share the same appearance and color as intervention drug.\n\nThe duration of the intervention will be 12 weeks. All participants are required to return to the clinic in the 6th and 12th week for a post-intervention assessment.\n\nFollow up\n\nThere are two follow-ups during this study. 1st follow-up will be on the 6th week and 2nd follow-up (final follow-up) will be during 12th week of the study.\n\nDuring the 6th week follow-up, participants will be checked for their weight, height, calculated Body Mass Index (BMI), TSS, NSS, RV-DQoL questionnaire, compliance, and adverse effects.\n\nA final visit (12th week) to the clinic will be conducted on the 12th week. During these visits, the outcome measures will be assessed to determine the effect of the fixed-dose combination of alpha lipoic acid and vitamin B. During this visit, the same measurement will be taken as visit 1."

          "briefSummary": "In patients with type 2 diabetes, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), which excludes a portion of the stomach and the proximal intestine from the alimentary circuit, improves glucose metabolism more rapidly and more extensively than is expected from weight loss. The mechanisms of this unique effect of gastrointestinal exclusion appear to be complex and have not yet been clarified. A recent study unveil that intestinal uptake of ingested glucose is diminished by RYGB and restricted to the common limb, where food meets bile and other digestive fluids, resulting in an overall decrease of post prandial blood glucose excursion. the hypothesize that reducing the length of the common limb, which is rarely measured and highly variable in clinical practice, may significantly affect the metabolic outcome of gastrointestinal surgical procedures. The aim of the present study is to compare the impact of two variants of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass with a short common limb, the long alimentary limb or the long biliary limb Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, on type 2 diabetes remission in severely obese patients."

A secondary objective is to determine if a loss-framed incentive for achieving sleep goals can increase sleep duration in 15 adolescent patients diagnosed with T2DM with insufficient sleep. Another secondary objective is to test if increasing sleep duration leads to improved glycemic control in 15 adolescents with T2DM identified in Aim 1 as having \\<8 hr sleep/evening. A focus group will be conducted prior to this intervention with patients ineligible for the intervention in order to determine appropriate text messaging.",
          "detailedDescription": "Aim 1 will be a cross-sectional study design utilizing actigraphy watch devices to estimate sleep duration. Participants will be recruited either before or after a routine outpatient clinic visit and asked to complete intake questionnaires. They will then be provided an actigraphy watch device which will be worn for 14 days to estimate sleep duration, and Libre continuous glucose monitor (CGM) to estimate glycemic control. After their visit, clinical data will be extracted from the electronic medical record.\n\nAim 2 will be an interventional study design utilizing Fitbit to perform a loss-framed incentive intervention designed to motivate participants to increase their sleep duration. Glycemic control will be measured via laboratory testing of hemoglobin A1c and Libre continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) for 2 weeks pre- and post-intervention.\n\nA focus group will be conducted prior to this intervention with patients ineligible for the intervention in order to determine appropriate text messaging."

At the end of the screening period, eligible participants will be randomized to one of two treatment groups (iGlarLixi or Gla-100 group). The randomization (1:1) will be stratified by values of HbA1c at screening (\\<8.0%, ≥8.0%), and background treatment (metformin only, metformin+SGLT-2i).\n\nStudy details include:\n\n* The study duration per participant will be approximately up to 24 weeks.\n* The treatment duration will be up to 20 weeks.\n* The number of visits will be 14 visits including 9 times of on-site visits and 5 times of phone call visits in total during screening and treatment periods. On-site every 1 week will be from screening till randomization (Week 0), then on site or phone call visit every 2 weeks till Week 12, then every 3 weeks till Week 18, and the End of Treatment visit will be conducted at Week 20. There will be a safety follow-up by a phone call visit (End of Study) in 3 days (-1/+3 days) after the last dose of the treatment.\n* Health measurement/Observation: change in TIR as the primary endpoint\n* Intervention name: iGlarLixi and Gla-100\n* Participant gender: male and female\n* Participant age range: adults at least 18 years of age\n* Condition/disease: type 2 diabetes\n* Study hypothesis: compared to Gla-100, iGlarLixi will demonstrate a superiority therapeutic effect on glycemic control assessed by change in TIR measured with CGM from baseline to Week 20 in the study participants."

          "briefSummary": "Subject: Subcutaneous (SC) insulin injection is frequently used in the treatment of Type 2 Diabetes patients. Complications such as pain, ecchymosis, hematoma, lipoatrophy and lipohypertrophy are frequently observed after SC injections. These complications that develop due to incorrect injection application negatively affect the use of injection application areas, change body image and negatively affect drug absorption. In order to reduce and prevent complications related to SC insulin injection, it is very important to gain the skill of safe SC insulin injection. It is stated that there are a limited number of studies on which of the teaching methods used in sick individuals are effective. In the national and international literature, no study has been found evaluating the effect of SC injection skill teaching based on video-supported training and low-fidelity simulation model applications on disease management in individuals diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. In this regard, the research was planned as an experimental design in order to examine the effectiveness of video-supported training and low-fidelity simulation model-based teaching in gaining safe insulin injection skills via SC. For this purpose; It is aimed to evaluate the effect of two different skill teaching methods on the patient's SC injection ability, complication management and blood glucose level.\n\nPurpose: This research was planned as an experimental design to examine the effectiveness of two different teaching methods (video-supported training and low-fidelity simulation model) in gaining safe insulin injection skills via the Subcutaneous (SC) route.\n\nDesign: A pretest-posttest two-group, quasi-experimental design will be used in the study."

Doctors cannot yet prescribe CagriSema. CagriSema will be compared to a medicine called tirzepatide. Doctors can prescribe tirzepatide in some countries. Participants will either receive CagriSema or tirzepatide. Which treatment the participant will receive is decided by chance. For each participant, the study will last for up to 1 year and 4 months."

          "detailedDescription": "The incidence of diabetic nephropathy has shown a year-by-year increase, establishing it as the leading cause of uremia. Despite guideline-recommended therapies such as RAS inhibitors, patients with diabetic nephropathy continue to face elevated risks of disease progression, particularly when massive proteinuria persists. Early intervention through nephropathy management can effectively slow renal function deterioration, demonstrating substantial clinical value in mitigating uremia risk.\n\nLC-Z300-01, a sugarcane-derived polysaccharide formulated as a dietary supplement, is being evaluated in this prospective, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized clinical trial. Sixty participants with confirmed diabetic nephropathy will be randomly allocated (1:1:1) to receive low-dose polysaccharide, high-dose polysaccharide, or placebo for 24 weeks of intervention and subsequent monitoring.\n\nThe predefined primary endpoint is the absolute change in uACR from baseline to week 24. Secondary endpoints encompass: (1) proportion of participants achieving ≥30% reduction in uACR versus baseline; (2) annualized eGFR decline rate; (3) HbA1c trajectory alterations; and (4) time-in-range (TIR) glycemic control metrics. Safety assessments will be conducted for all enrolled subjects receiving ≥1 administered dose."

The study will compare the microbial and metabolomics analysis from the sample collected with the capsule series, to same-participant symptom questionnaires and stool microbial analysis.",
          "detailedDescription": "The investigators primary goal is to assess the correlation of gut symptoms from various disease states with the dysbiosis of the small intestinal microbiome and metabolites collected by the SIMBA capsule, and as identified and measured by metagenomic sequencing and/or metabolomics approaches. The process consists of ingestion and collection of up to 4 SIMBA capsules, on up to 2 separate occasions, along with collection of a stool sample at the same time. Participants will also fill out a series of questionnaires on medical history and lifestyle inputs (eg. diet, exercise, mental health) GI symptoms, anxiety, and depression. The investigators ultimate goal will be to develop a better understanding of how the small intestinal microbiome might play a role in symptom generation, to establish whether the SIMBA capsule can find a signature of dysbiosis which can be used as a biomarker for a number of functional gut disorders."

Known disease which, in the investigator's opinion, would lead to intestinal structuring or obstruction with a risk of capsule non-excretion (particular diseases which would be assessed on a case-by-case basis would include, achalasia, eosinophilic esophagitis, cancer diagnosis or treatment within the past year, or previous esophageal, gastric, small intestinal, or colonic surgery. Appendectomy or cholecystectomy more than 3 months prior to enrollment are acceptable). The main deciding factor would be a history of obstructive symptoms in the previous 3 months prior to entry.\n2. Use of any medications or having undergone procedures in the previous week that could substantially alter gastrointestinal motor function (e.g., opioids, anticholinergics, laxatives, or GLP-1 analogues).\n\n   1. Stimulant laxative use (includes bisacodyl/Dulcolax, senna/Senekot, cascara, or fibre supplments) is allowed if it is kept unchanged in the week prior to the SIMBA Capsule ingestion. Osmotic laxatives (polyethylene glycol (PEG; other trade names), milk of magnesia, lactulose), stool softeners (docusate; other trade names) or secretagogues (linaclotide/Constella, plecanatide/Trulance, tenapanor/Ibsrela should not be used within 7 days of taking the SIMBA capsules.\n   2. Prokinetics use is allowed if kept unchanged in the week prior to the SIMBA Capsule ingestion (includes domperidone, metoclopramide, prucalopride). Inconsistent use of prokinetics will be evaluated by the PI.\n   3. PPI or H2RA use. Must be able to discontinue PPI or H2RA medications 48hrs prior to SIMBA capsule ingestion, medication can be resumed 4 hours after ingestion.\n3. History of oropharyngeal dysphagia or other swallowing disorder with a risk of aspiration of the capsule.\n4. History of known structural gastrointestinal abnormalities such as strictures or fistulas leading to mechanical obstruction\n5. History of abdominal radiation treatment\n6. Females of childbearing age who are pregnant or lactating by self-report. (should an X-ray be required for confirmation of capsule passage, a urine pregnancy test will be administered beforehand).\n7. No antibiotics, or colon cleanses/bowel prep for 2 weeks.\n8. \\< 2 bowel movements per week (Control Group only).",

The femoral head will be taken to the Robarts Research Institute (London, ON, Canada) for lineage-restricted progenitor cell expansion and analyses. There the femoral heads will be used to isolate three stem cell types - Multipotent Stromal Cells, Endothelial Colony Forming Cells, and Hematopoietic Progenitor Cells. The yield and cell surface markers expressed on these cells will be measured using flow cytometry. These cell types will then undergo further analyses of the secretome, tubule forming assays, vascular regenerative cell exhaustion assays, and will be transplanted into immune deficient mice with with femoral artery ligation. These experiments are to assess the differences in function and expression of these cell types between individuals with type-2 diabetes and/or obesity and/or healthy controls.",
          "detailedDescription": "Femoral Heads will be extracted by Dr. Lanting (Department of Surgery - Division of Orthopaedics) at University Hospital, they will then be transferred to Robarts Research Institute where they will undergo cell isolation and analyses. Multipotent Stromal Cells, Endothelial Colony Forming Cells, and Hematopoietic Progenitor Cells will be extracted from the bone marrow of the femoral heads. These cells will be used to characterize the difference in regenerative progenitor cell number and potential dysfunction in individuals with type 2 diabetes and/or obesity compared to controls. Analysis will include growth kinetics, flow cytometry, Bio Luminescent Imaging and Laser Doppler Perfusion Imaging using a FAL mouse model."

          "briefSummary": "Insomnia is highly prevalent in individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and is associated with poor glycemic control. Louisiana has one of the highest diabetes prevalence rates in the U.S., with significant disparities by race, income, and rural residence. Despite growing recognition of sleep's role in diabetes management, sleep disturbances remain largely unaddressed in diabetes care. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) is the first-line treatment for chronic insomnia, yet it is underutilized in primary care clinics such as federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) that serve high-risk populations.\n\nThe long-term goal of this research is to improve cardiometabolic health and reduce diabetes disparities by integrating sleep interventions into diabetes care. This pilot study aims to: (1) evaluate the impact of CBT-I on sleep and diabetes-related outcomes, and (2) assess the acceptability, feasibility, and fidelity of implementing an 8-week CBT-I program in an FQHC setting.\n\nThe investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 30 FQHC patients (aged 40+) with uncontrolled T2D (HbA1c \\>7%) and comorbid insomnia (Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) score ≥15). Participants will be randomly assigned to either the CBT-I intervention or usual care. Sleep (ISI scores, actigraphy) and cardiometabolic (HbA1c, fasting glucose, insulin) outcomes will be assessed at baseline and three months post-randomization. Implementation success will be evaluated using fidelity, feasibility, and acceptability measures. Findings will provide preliminary evidence for integrating CBT-I into primary care, informing larger trials to improve diabetes outcomes and reduce disparities in Louisiana."

          "detailedDescription": "About 43 hospitals from different parts of China will take part in this study. Patients aged ≥18 years who have been previously treated with a stable dose of insulin and no more than three classes of oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs) for at least 12 weeks without adequate glycemic control will be enrolled and assigned to either cofrogliptin once every 2 weeks cohort or linagliptin once-daily cohort based on the prescription. Initiation of cofrogliptin or linagliptin treatment was at the treating physician's discretion.\n\nEnrolled participants will undergo routine follow-up for up to 24 weeks. During the follow-up period, data will be collected from face-to-face participant-investigator visits at the beginning of the study (0 weeks, visit 1), early stage (4 weeks, visit 2), mid-stage (12 weeks, visit 3) and at the end of the study (24 weeks, visit 4). Data sources include patient medical records, diaries, self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG), and questionnaires. No additional diagnostics, monitoring procedures, or interventions outside of usual clinical practice will be applied to the participants. The project will probably last for about 24 months."

          "briefSummary": "Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease that can cause many complications, one of the most common being diabetic neuropathy. This condition occurs due to long-term high blood sugar levels that damage the nerves. Symptoms include tingling, burning, pain, and loss of sensation in the feet. If not prevented, neuropathy can progress to diabetic foot ulcers and even lead to amputation.\n\nThis study aims to evaluate whether Golden Rice Cookies enriched with Red Betel Leaf (Piper crocatum) can help prevent diabetic neuropathy in patients with diabetes. Golden rice is a type of rice that contains beta-carotene (provitamin A) and high fiber, which help maintain stable blood sugar levels and reduce oxidative stress. Meanwhile, red betel leaf contains flavonoids, polyphenols, and alkaloids with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and hypoglycemic properties that may protect nerves from damage.\n\nCookies were chosen as the intervention form because they are practical, easy to consume, and widely accepted by patients. In this study, patients will be divided into two groups: an intervention group receiving golden rice cookies with red betel leaf extract, and a control group receiving golden rice cookies without the extract. Changes in neuropathy symptoms will be assessed using the Neuropathy Symptom Score (NSS) before and after the intervention.\n\nThe expected outcome of this research is to provide scientific evidence that the combination of golden rice and red betel leaf in the form of cookies can serve as an effective, safe, and acceptable functional food to help prevent diabetic neuropathy. This nutritional intervention may support comprehensive diabetes management and improve patients' quality of life.",
          "detailedDescription": "Diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disease with a steadily increasing prevalence worldwide. One of its most common and burdensome complications is diabetic neuropathy, which affects up to 50% of patients with type 2 diabetes. This condition is characterized by pain, tingling, or loss of sensation, particularly in the feet, and is a major risk factor for diabetic foot ulcers and amputations. Current management strategies mainly focus on strict glycemic control and the treatment of neuropathic pain, while preventive nutritional approaches remain limited.\n\nWith the growing interest in functional foods, new opportunities have emerged to support diabetes care. Golden rice, genetically enriched with beta-carotene (provitamin A), provides antioxidant and anti-inflammatory benefits along with dietary fiber that helps stabilize blood glucose levels. Red betel leaf (Piper crocatum), traditionally used in herbal medicine, contains flavonoids, polyphenols, and alkaloids with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and hypoglycemic properties that may protect nerves from damage caused by chronic hyperglycemia. The combination of these two functional ingredients offers promising neuroprotective potential for the prevention of diabetic neuropathy.\n\nThis study is designed as a randomized controlled trial using cookies made from golden rice enriched with Piper crocatum as the intervention. Cookies are chosen as the delivery form because they are practical, well-accepted by patients, and easy to consume regularly compared with supplements or herbal preparations. Participants will be divided into two groups: an intervention group receiving golden rice cookies with Piper crocatum extract, and a control group receiving golden rice cookies without the extract.\n\nThroughout the 28-day intervention period, changes in neuropathy symptoms will be evaluated using the Neuropathy Symptom Score (NSS) before and after consumption. The study aims to determine whether the addition of Piper crocatum provides added benefits in preventing or reducing neuropathy symptoms compared with golden rice cookies alone.\n\nThis research is expected to provide scientific evidence on the role of combining golden rice and Piper crocatum in cookie form as an innovative functional food for the prevention of diabetic neuropathy. Such a nutritional intervention may offer an effective, safe, affordable, and acceptable strategy to support comprehensive diabetes management and improve patients' quality of life."

Men with diabetes mellitus are commonly found to have low testosterone as well. Testosterone has been shown to improve the bone health of patients with low testosterone but has not been tested in patients who also have diabetes mellitus in addition to low testosterone. To date, there is no treatment that is specifically recommended for bone disease among patients with diabetes. This study will evaluate the effect of testosterone on the bone health of male Veterans who have both diabetes and low testosterone, both of which are highly prevalent in this subset of the population.",
          "detailedDescription": "An existing mutual influence between testosterone (T) and glucose metabolism has been suggested by studies showing that men with low T have impaired glucose tolerance, while a significant number of men with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) and obesity have low T. Thus, it is not surprising that as much as 64% of men with T2D were found to have low T. Hypogonadism and diabetes mellitus (DM) each is associated with increased risk for fractures. While hypogonadism is associated with increased bone turnover and bone loss. DM is associated with low bone turnover and normal or high bone mineral density (BMD) but paradoxically a high risk for fractures. The preliminary data showed that compared to non-diabetic hypogonadal men, men with both conditions have suppressed bone turnover, higher volumetric BMD (vBMD) and smaller bone size. As the effect of T on the male skeleton is mainly mediated by its conversion to estradiol (E2) by the enzyme aromatase, the possibility of further suppression of bone turnover with T therapy in these patients would be a concern. However, the investigators' initial data also showed that T therapy in men with both conditions resulted in increased in markers of bone turnover and bone size compared to the decrease in bone turnover and decrease in bone size in men with hypogonadism only, suggesting activation in bone remodeling and improvement in bone geometry in the former. Furthermore, the investigators also found a trend for increase in bone strength (by finite element analysis or FEA) in the limited number of men with both low T and T2D randomized to T compared to placebo. These findings only suggest but do not prove with certainty that T therapy would be beneficial to men with both low T and T2D. The central hypothesis of this study is that T therapy will result in improvement in bone quality in patients who have both hypogonadism and T2D. Thus, the specific aims of this proposal are: 1) to determine the effect of T therapy on bone strength as assessed by finite element analysis ( FEA) using high-resolution peripheral quantitative computer tomography (HR-pQCT), 2) to determine the effect of T therapy on markers of bone turnover, and 3) an exploratory aim, to evaluate the mechanism for improvement in bone quality from T therapy. The investigators hypothesize that because T stimulates osteoblastic proliferation and differentiation, the ensuing increase in osteoblast number will lead to an enhanced cross-talk between osteoblast and osteoclast resulting in activation of bone remodeling and replacement of old with new bone, hence, improvement in bone quality. In this study the investigators will enroll 166 men with T2D and hypogonadism and randomize them to either testosterone gel 1.62% or placebo for 12 months.\n\nThe following main outcomes will be evaluated: aim# 1) change in the primary endpoint which is FEA, by HRpQCT, #2) changes in C-telopeptide (CTX) a marker of bone resorption, and aim #3) changes in circulating osteoblast progenitor (COP). The investigators anticipate an increase in FEA at the tibia and radius suggesting improvement in bone strength, increase CTX and increase in circulating osteoblast progenitors. The investigators further anticipate an increase in other markers of bone turnover (both bone formation and resorption) and osteoclast precursors in men with hypogonadism and T2D randomized to T compared to placebo. Given the suppressed bone turnover at baseline in men with low T and T2D, the investigators hypothesize that the beneficial effect of T is its effect in activating bone remodeling ultimately resulting in improvement in bone quality.\n\nResults from this study will provide information on the utility of T not only in improving quality of life but also in improving bone quality in hypogonadal men with T2D. Given the relationship between glucose metabolism and testosterone production, and the increasing number of male patients diagnosed with both hypogonadism and T2D, this study will benefit not only the significant number of male Veterans who have both conditions but also men in general."

              "description": "The FEA (or FEA) is a surrogate measure of strength using computational biomechanical principles and integrate bone morphology and bone mass to calculate bone strength under various loading conditions normally seen in daily living activities. In addition, the ratio of load to strength can be calculated by using patient information (i.e. weight and height) and FEA derived bone strength to mechanistically simulate bone failure and thus, whether fracture is likely during a given activity. Using high-resolution peripheral quantitative computer tomography (HRPQCT) we will compute for FEA, using FEA software with images generated using Image Processing Language to estimate the biomechanical properties of the bone. Each bone voxel will be converted to hexahedral finite elements with linear-elastic and isotropic material behavior. The FEA model will be subject to uniaxial compression and stiffness and failure load will be estimated. FEA will be assessed at months 0, 6 and 12.",
              "populationDescription": "There were 2 dropouts in the testosterone group thus, 44 participants finished the study. However, the imaging studies of one patient who finished the study is not optimum for FEA.\n\nThere were 4 dropouts in the placebo thus, 42 participants finished the study. However, the investigators were unable to assess the finite element analysis in one patient as HRPQCT machine broke down when the participant came for final visit and refused to come again just for this assessment.",

The investigators are looking to recruit 80 Black men with type 2 diabetes (T2D) (need to have diagnosis for at least one year) that are over the age of 18. Participants also must be under the care of a physician for their diabetes, self report an Hemoglobin A1c (A1C) of 7.0% or more in the last year, be willing to participate in study events (weekly physical activity, exercise and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) sessions, group discussion sessions, and in-person health assessments), have reliable internet access (steady internet connection or unlimited data) that will allow them to use a tablet/phone/computer to complete study related tasks, live in the Wayne or Washtenaw County, and have reliable transportation to in-person events. All participants will receive 8 hours/sessions of cognitive behavioral therapy. Participants randomized to the intervention arm will also receive 8 sessions of guided exercise at the same time. Following that they will also receive 8 group discussion sessions that will serve as on-going support. All sessions will be help via Zoom. Additionally, all participants will participate in The 4 health assessments will take place at baseline, 10 weeks, 18 weeks, and 30 weeks."

          "briefSummary": "The relationship between nut consumption and the risk of developing non-communicable diseases (NCDs) has been a subject of growing interest. However, the findings from previous studies have been conflicting for some health outcomes, such as type-2 diabetes, and have been underexplored for other outcomes, such as neurodegenerative diseases. One contributing factor to these inconsistencies lies in the different analytical approaches and confounding factors used across studies. Furthermore, the majority of previous studies have primarily focused on populations in Europe or the United States, potentially limiting the generalizability of the findings to other global regions. The NUTPOOL project aims to address these gaps by conducting an extensive individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis. This study will evaluate the association between total and specific types of nut consumption and the future risk of NCDs.",
          "detailedDescription": "NCDs account for 74% of global deaths, with 41% of these occurring prematurely in individuals aged 70 years and older. Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases (CVD), and cancer are among the major chronic diseases that affect people across countries and contribute to premature deaths. Notably, 77% of all NCD deaths and 86% of premature deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries. Reducing premature mortality from NCDs through preventive strategies, especially in low- and middle-income countries, was identified as a target in the Sustainable Development Goals from the World Health Organization. Additionally, as populations age, dementia is gaining recognition as a major public health concern. Dementia is among the leading causes of death and disability, with significant economic implications. Therefore, implementing preventive strategies to maintain cognitive function and delay cognitive decline is essential.\n\nAdhering to a healthy diet is an effective and cost-efficient strategy to reduce NCDs. In fact, unhealthy diets have been linked to over 30% of NCDs and cognitive decline. Nuts are a common food component of several plant-based diets that have shown beneficial effects in preventing NCDs. Nuts are a diverse food group comprising a wide variety of oily kernels with a unique nutritional profile, including high amounts of protein, fiber, unsaturated fatty acids, vitamins, polyphenols, and other phytochemicals. These nutrients may contribute to their beneficial effects, such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antihypertensive, anti-lipidemic, and anti-aging properties, as well as their potential positive influence on gut microbiota modulation.\n\nPrior research has examined the impact of nuts on various health outcomes; however, many of these studies have focused on intermediate outcomes, obtained controversial results, and have been conducted primarily in European countries or the United States. Furthermore, the data has been analyzed using a variety of approaches, the studies were designed in different ways, and different covariates were added to the statistical models, potentially leading to inconsistencies and compromising the reliability of the comparison between studies. These inconsistencies emphasize the need for further research to elucidate the role of total nuts and specific types of nut consumption on the development of highly prevalent NCDs, as well as to allow the generalizability of the results across different countries and ethnicities.\n\nIn the NUTPOOL project, the objective is to address these knowledge gaps and provide a thorough assessment of the associations between total nuts and specific types of nuts in relation to a wide range of NCDs and mortality. The results from this global collaborative project will be representative of the worldwide populations, as they include prospective cohort studies from different countries, including not only American and European countries, but also Asian and Oceania. Additionally, the focus is on total and specific types of nuts, along with highly prevalent and relevant outcomes such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer, dementia, and mortality. To ensure consistency and reliability, the analyses will be standardized using Individual Participant Data (IPD) meta-analyses.\n\nThe selection of studies will be conducted after the identification of cohorts with data available on nut consumption. This identification process will be based on information comprehensively extracted from recently published systematic reviews and meta-analysis (SRMAs) on the subject, as well as through extensive research network. Invitations will be extended to as many eligible cohorts as possible to mitigate selection bias and ensure comprehensive participation in the study. Studies will be eligible for inclusion if they reported reliable nutrition data from a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) regarding total nuts and/or specific nuts, along with well-defined data on at least two of the health outcomes. The study population had to be at least 1,000 adults, and the study had to span a minimum of five years or more of median follow-up, enabling time-dependent analyses.\n\nThe assessment of nut consumption involves standardizing the amount consumed to a standard serving size (1 serving = 28 g or 1 oz.). The cumulative average or baseline nut consumption will be used according to the data collection methods employed for each cohort. Nut consumption will be analyzed as both a continuous and a categorical variable. The methods used to ascertain high-prevalence NCDs include medical diagnosis, official national or regional death registers, self-reported cases, and medication checks.\n\nThe statistical analysis plan will entail the subsequent two steps: First, each cohort will follow a standardized and harmonized protocol to analyze the data. Secondly, centralized meta-analyses will be performed. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models will be used to estimate the risk of NCDs. Separate models will be conducted for categories of total nuts and specific types of nuts. A dose-response analysis will also be conducted. The models will include different levels of adjustment:\n\n* Model 1: age and sex\n* Model 2: M1 + race, family history of NCDs of interest, personal history of hypercholesterolemia, education level, physical activity, alcohol consumption, smoking, total energy intake, cohort specific adjustements (e.g. allocation to intervention group for intervention cohorts; recruitment centre for multi-centre cohorts; socio-economic status and urban/rural residence, as deemed appropriate)\n* Model 3: M2 + red and processed meat, fruit and vegetable, potatoes, fish, legume, egg, cereal, whole grain, coffee, tea, sugar- and artificially-sweetened beverages and cooking fats. For analysis by subtype of nuts, model 2 will also be mutually adjusted for each other types of nut.\n* Model 4: M3 + body mass index Subgroups analyses will be performed based on age, sex, race, educational level, physical activity level, smoking status, body weight status, hypercholesterolemia and diabetes status at baseline.\n\nAll analyses will be restricted to participants with complete data on age, sex, nut consumption, or the disease of interest. The missing data will be handled as follows: a) If there is more than 20% missing data for a covariate, the variable will not be included in the adjustment models; b) If there is 20% or less missing data, for continuous variables, the media should be imputed, and for categorical variables, an additional missing category should be created and used it in the models to avoid losing count or power.\n\nOnce all the cohorts have provided the summary statistics, and the results have been verified and harmonized, they will be combined by inverse-variance weighted random effects meta-analyses (DerSimonian and Laird procedure). The between-study variance will be used to assess heterogeneity. To ensure the reliability of the results, additional meta-analyses will be conducted by systematically excluding one cohort at a time. Statistical meta-analyses will be performed using Stata/SE software, version 18.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX)."

          "detailedDescription": "For the ENRxICH intervention, all participants will receive usual care for their diabetes management. Participants will be randomized to one of four treatment conditions: 1. Usual Care, 2. Medication Therapy Management (MTM) Optimizing Medication Therapy (ON), 3. Community Health Worker (CHW) addressing social determinants of health (SDOH) and diabetes and medicine misperceptions (ON), or 4. both MTM Optimizing Medication Therapy and CHW Addressing SDOH and diabetes and medicine misperceptions for 6 months.\n\nSubjects randomized to the treatment conditions including MTM will receive a minimum of five pharmacist-delivered Medication Therapy Management (MTM) sessions with a pharmacist, two in the first month, one medication review each in the second and third month, and a final medication review at 6 months.\n\nSubjects randomized to the treatment conditions including CHW support addressing social determinants of health (SDOH) which will involve meeting with the CHW for a formal, standardized 2-hour assessment of five common SDOH barriers related to diabetes management, (1) food insecurity, (2) transportation, (3) prescription medication assistance, (4) access to diabetes education, and (5) physical activity resources (See Table 6). After the initial session at the participant's home (or another community location), the participant will have the option of continuing to work with the CHW to address barriers for the intervention duration. CHW support will also address diabetes and medicine misperceptions by completing a series of phone calls with the subject to provide information about managing diabetes and medicines, discuss cultural health misperceptions, share medication adherence experiences, and provide social support over the phone."

Upon approval, information necessary to address the research question will be provided under the terms of a data sharing agreement.

          "briefSummary": "The goal of this study is to learn about how the hormone insulin controls blood sugar. The main question it aims to answer is about how much insulin the body actually needs to maintain a normal blood sugar level. People with obesity and high insulin levels will receive eight doses of diazoxide, a drug that suppresses the pancreas's production of insulin, and will have their fasting blood sugar and insulin levels checked daily while taking the drug.",
          "detailedDescription": "The investigators are interested in determining to what extent the hyperinsulinemia commonly associated with insulin resistance (IR) in those at risk for type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a primary phenomenon, rather than merely a secondary, compensatory response to IR. The study hypothesis is that some people with obesity and hyperinsulinemia exhibit a primary, non-compensatory hyperinsulinemia that may foment IR and its dysmetabolic sequelae. If this were the case, lowering insulin levels should not result in a proportional rise in blood glucose as might be expected if the hyperinsulinemia truly were purely compensatory. This hypothesis has been difficult to prove, however, because of the tight feedback mechanism between blood glucose and insulin secretion; under normal circumstances insulin secretion declines only alongside blood glucose. As such, an attempt to lower insulin levels independently of blood glucose will raise blood glucose and trigger further insulin secretion, negating the purpose of the experiment. In order to circumvent this feedback regulation of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, the study team has developed a modification of the insulin suppression test (IST) called the \"graded IST\" (GIST) that suppresses endogenous insulin secretion with octreotide and then measures steady-state plasma glucose (SSPG) at both replacement euinsulinemia and hyperinsulinemia. It is expected that some people with high insulin levels at baseline will not demonstrate a prominent rise in SSPG even when their insulin levels are lowered. However, the GIST is a cumbersome procedure that is difficult to scale for larger study populations. As such, the investigators are also working to develop an outpatient diazoxide suppression test (DzST) that suppresses endogenous insulin secretion with the oral insulin anti-secretagogue diazoxide rather than octreotide, and will validate it against the incipient \"gold-standard\" GIST. GIST participants found to have evidence of primary hyperinsulinemia (i.e., euinsulinemic euglycemia or near-euglycemia despite baseline hyperinsulinemia) will, several weeks later, take diazoxide 3 mg/kg per dose, twice daily, for four days. The investigators will check fasting glucose and insulin levels daily at baseline and then after each of the four days of diazoxide administration. The investigators expect that suppression of insulin secretion with diazoxide will, in accordance with the GIST, lead to no significant rise in blood glucose in people who have true primary hyperinsulinemia."

          "briefSummary": "Sarcopenia is a syndrome characterized by loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength, and physical performance deterioration. Prevalence of sarcopenia in elderly people is remarkably high (prevalence of about 25% in 60+ years people). In type 2 diabetes (T2D), sarcopenia is emerging as comorbidity of major concern. Sarcopenia, however, is not limited to elderly people, as it can develop also in younger individuals with prevalence around 9% or even higher according to some investigators. Of note, sarcopenia has been reported even in the 20-29 years interval. This interval includes women of childbearing age, thus raising the question whether sarcopenia may occur also in women with gestational diabetes (GDM) and whether this may affect pregnancy outcomes. Also, association between sarcopenia and cognitive impairment has been repeatedly reported, to the point that some authors have emphasized the importance of early sarcopenia recognition for prevention of cognitive impairment. Therefore, our main aims are:\n\n1. To ascertain whether sarcopenia is present in GDM and, in that case, its prevalence;\n2. To identify risk factors for sarcopenia;\n3. To determine sarcopenia impact on pregnancy outcomes, and cognitive function.\n\nDuring pregnancy, all women will undergo oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) for assessment of the glucometabolic condition. Several clinical variables of interest in sarcopenia will also be recorded. As regards the OGTT data, special focus will be on the assessment of insulin resistance, both at fasting and during the dynamic conditions determined by the OGTT. Notably, the special interest for insulin resistance is due to the reason that this type of metabolic alteration is known to be a risk factor for sarcopenia. In fact, all women will then undergo testing for diagnosis of sarcopenia (or presarcopenia), and all data and parameters will be analyzed to identify relationships between sarcopenia-related variables and GDM-related ones. It is worth noting that in consideration of the exacerbated insulin resistance condition often observed in GDM, the investigators expect indeed a not negligible prevalence of sarcopenia (or at least presarcopenia) in GDM women, despite the young (non-elderly) age. In addition, since insulin resistance is often present in pregnancy even in the absence of dysglycemia, the investigators do not exclude to identify some cases of sarcopenia/presarcopenia even in pregnant non-GDM women. This study will be the basis for future studies (also of interventional type), especially in women with GDM for prevention of sarcopenia and related possible pregnancy complication and adverse pregnancy outcomes, as well as for possibly contributing to mitigation of risk for T2D development in later life."

This can lead to an improper supply of oxygen and nutrients to the retinal tissue, or it may trigger the formation of new blood vessels in response to the oxygen/nutrient deficiency. Ultimately affecting the normal vision. There is no known marker that will provide information on the health status of retinal blood vessels. Using highly specialized cells in the blood, this study will try to discover a marker of DR."

          "briefSummary": "The study aims to investigate whether intranasal oxytocin (OXT) improves sexual well-being in patients with Arginine Vasopressin Deficiency (AVP-D). The trial consists of two parts: Part A assesses the effect of OXT on sexual well-being and intimacy over a 7-day treatment period in participants in a stable partnership. Part B assesses the effect of a single dose OXT on sexual arousal, fear and empathy in a clinical setting and is designed for single participants and those in partnerships.",
          "detailedDescription": "Disruption of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, caused by inflammation, tumors, or head trauma, can result in arginine vasopressin (AVP) deficiency (AVP-D), formerly known as central diabetes insipidus (cDI). This condition is characterized by polyuria and polydipsia, leading to significant disruptions in the body's fluid balance. Desmopressin, an AVP receptor analogue, is the standard treatment for AVP-D and effectively mitigates these physical symptoms.\n\nHowever, patients with AVP-D frequently report residual psychological symptoms that remain unaddressed despite desmopressin therapy. These include impaired emotion recognition, reduced empathy, heightened anxiety, social interaction difficulties, and decreased sexual desire-all of which significantly affect their quality of life. Recent data from an international survey of over 1,000 patients with AVP-D reinforce these findings, highlighting the psychosocial burden of this condition.\n\nOxytocin (OXT), a neuropeptide closely associated with AVP in terms of anatomical location and function, is known to play a critical role in social, emotional, and behavioral regulation. As a \"pro-social\" hormone, OXT fosters trust, intimacy, attachment, and pair bonding, while also mitigating stress. The proximity of the AVP and OXT systems within the brain suggests that disruptions in one could potentially lead to deficiencies in the other. Supporting this hypothesis, recent research using a novel stimulation test with MDMA demonstrated an OXT deficiency in patients with AVP-D, offering a potential explanation for their observed psychopathology.\n\nOXT's influence extends to sexual well-being, where it has been shown to enhance bonding, intimacy, and the emotional aspects of sexual relationships. Elevated OXT levels are observed during labor, lactation, and sexual arousal, and studies suggest correlations between OXT and orgasm intensity, sexual satisfaction, and partner attachment. While previous studies have examined OXT's effects on social and emotional behavior in healthy individuals, its therapeutic potential in addressing psychological and sexual well-being in AVP-D patients remains unexplored.\n\nThis study aims to investigate whether intranasal OXT administration can improve sexual well-being, intimacy, and pair bonding in patients with AVP-D. By addressing an unrecognized OXT deficiency, this research seeks to fill a critical gap in understanding and managing the psychosocial challenges associated with AVP-D.\n\nThe trial employs a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over design and consists of two parts:\n\n1. Part A involves a seven-day treatment with intranasal OXT (24 IU) or placebo in patients with AVP-D and their partners. Participants will self-assess their sexual well-being and intimacy at baseline and after each treatment period, with a three-week washout period between treatments.\n2. Part B evaluates the acute effects of a single intranasal OXT dose (24 IU) or placebo on sexual arousal, empathy, fear perception, and hormonal responses to visual stimuli in both single and partnered patients with AVP-D, compared to healthy controls.\n\nThis comprehensive approach will provide insights into both the long-term and immediate impacts of OXT therapy, with the ultimate goal of improving quality of life for patients with AVP-D."

Using a cross-over design with a three-week washout aligned to the female participant's menstrual cycle, only couples in stable relationships are eligible. Participants complete self-evaluations at baseline and after each treatment period.\n* Part B, conducted in a clinical setting, includes single participants and those in relationships. It assesses subjective sexual arousal, fear perception, empathy, and physical and hormonal responses to visual stimuli following intranasal OXT or placebo. Randomized participants receive a single application of OXT or placebo, with a 72-hour or three-week washout depending on study participation.",

          "briefSummary": "The DUNDRUM Forensic Redevelopment Evaluation study (D-FOREST study) is a multi-site comprehensive evaluation of a complete National Forensic Mental Health Service. The study will have a prospective, observational, longitudinal design which will permit the evaluation of benefit over time for individual patients, groups of patients and the evaluation of the benefit in terms of service based outcomes of the redevelopment of a complete National Forensic Mental Health Service e.g. effects on waiting list times, length of stay. The study will systematically evaluate multiple domains of recovery in a complete National Forensic Service, including patients' physical health, mental health, offending behaviours and social and occupational functioning.",
          "detailedDescription": "The DUNDRUM Forensic Redevelopment Evaluation Study (D-FOREST).\n\nForensic Mental Health Services have a dual role, to treat mental disorder and reduce violent recidivism. Forensic mental health services are low volume, high cost services and therefore it is vital to conduct robust outcome measure studies to demonstrate benefit and effectiveness. D-FOREST is a study comprising the evaluation of a complete national forensic mental health service at a time of significant change, that of the re-development of Ireland's National Forensic Mental Health Service from a 19th century building to a complete national service in North Dublin.\n\nWe hypothesise that the redevelopment of the campus from Dundrum Hospital to a new 170-bed hospital in Portrane will demonstrate improvements in two main areas, firstly service wide improvements and secondly patient benefit related improvements.\n\nWe hypothesise that the development of the new campus at Portrane will lead to reduced time on the waiting list for admission and reduced length of stay in the hospital as well as sustainable rates of admissions and discharges maintained over the five year period of this study.\n\nWe anticipate that the newly expanded hospital will be able to facilitate the admission of patients with higher security needs from the prison settings, and therefore there may be a rise in the security needs profile of the group, while urgency of need for admission on the waiting list will decrease.\n\nWe anticipate that patient engagement with group and individual therapy will improve with greater access to therapists as the staff number will expand and therefore measures of therapeutic programme completion and recovery and measures of risk in a broad sense should improve across the patient group. We also anticipate finding improved measures of patient ratings on environmental measures such as ward atmosphere on moving to the new campus.\n\nRepeated measures in the area of physical health, mental health and violence risk and forensic recovery will be taken, at baseline (time of admission to the service) as well as at six-monthly intervals throughout the patients admission journey. These main areas will include structured interview measures of psychopathology e.g. SCID, PANSS, clinician rated measures violence and self-harm risk assessment instruments e.g. HCR-20, SRAMM, and measures of therapeutic programme completion and recovery (DUNDRUM-3 and DUNDRUM-4 scales) as well as overall functioning MIRECC GAF. Physical health measures will include measures of BMI, frailty and sedentary behaviours.\n\nOther measures including ward atmosphere scales ESSENCES and measures of quality of life (WHO-QUOL) will also be offered to the patient group to complete.\n\nA combination of both self-rated and interview based measures to engage patients, and clinician rated measures will be used. This is due to the high rates of treatment resistant psychoses in forensic hospital settings, and therefore to rely on self-rated or interview rated measures along would mean that many of the most unwell patients may not be able or willing to engage. Thus utilising this combination approach ensures that any bias in the results and outcomes observed will be minimised.\n\nStatistical analysis plan:\n\nStatistical methods for primary and secondary outcomes. Time intervals (time in days to admission from waiting list, length of stay) will be measured by median and 95% confidence interval using Kaplan Meyer and Cox regression analyses. Survival analysis will be used to assess factors affecting length of stay.\n\nPatient level measures will be expressed as changes from baseline (typically from the time of admission) using ANCOVA, MANOVA or logistic regression as appropriate with correction for the effects of static baseline variables such as demographic characteristics (e.g. age, sex and ethnicity) or diagnosis including multi-axial diagnoses, neurocognitive function, and legal status. Measures of effect size will be used alongside measures of statistical significance for primary and secondary outcomes. At the individual level measures of reliable and clinically meaningful change will be calculated and proportions achieving this will be expressed with 95% confidence intervals.\n\nAnalysis of repeated measures will be used to compare mean scores on measures of physical health, risk of violence, therapeutic programme completion, recovery and overall functioning, at time points in advance of the move of the NFMHS to the new Portrane Hospital Campus and for five years after the move.\n\nLagged causal model analysis will be used to assess the existence and significance of potential directed relationships between the baseline measures of symptomatology of schizophrenia and violence risk and final outcome namely length of stay.\n\nThe lagged causal model approach will be used also to examine the relationship between amount of 'treatment' received and change in outcome measures."

          "briefSummary": "The CONNECT: \"Developing a learning COmmunity to increase eNgagemeNt and Enrollment in cardiovascular Clinical Trials\" is comprehensive, participant-centered learning platform designed to increase diversity in cardiovascular disease research among women and Black and Latino adults. CONNECT will deploy electronic health record (EHR)-informed and community-engaged recruitment approaches to identify and recruit adults with cardiovascular disease or a cardiovascular disease risk factor to join CONNECT. Participants who join CONNECT will receive tailored educational information on cardiovascular health and research participation via text message. Participants will also have the opportunity to be connected to ongoing cardiovascular research studies based on basic demographic information and areas of interest. The educational information will be sent to participants for 12 months. The CONNECT platform will be used to evaluate recruitment methods. The investigators hypothesize the proportion of women and Black and Latin adults enrolled in trials that partner with CONNECT will be higher following the use of CONNECT for recruitment. Investigators also hypothesize that participating in CONNECT will increase participants' clinical trial awareness, trust, and willingness to participate in clinical trials.",
          "detailedDescription": "The CONNECT project, titled \"Developing a learning COmmunity to increase eNgagemeNt and Enrollment in cardiovascular Clinical Trials,\" seeks to establish an comprehensive learning platform aimed at improving diversity and representation in cardiovascular research. It encompasses three primary objectives:\n\n1. Identifying best practices for research recruitment and engagement among women and Black and Latino adults.\n2. Increasing participation in cardiovascular health research among women and Black and Latino adults.\n3. Improving trust in and awareness of cardiovascular research among women and Black and Latino adults.\n\nA multi-method recruitment campaign will be implemented, utilizing both electronic health record (EHR)-informed and community-based strategies. A sub-study will be conducted to understand the effectiveness of EHR-informed recruitment. This sub-study will randomly assign a subsample of individuals identified in the EHR to one of three outreach modalities: patient portal message, email, and postal mail. Enrollment yield will be calculated for each recruitment method, with logistic regression modeling estimating the odds of enrollment by recruitment outreach type, both overall and among different demographic groups.\n\nUpon enrollment, participants will specify preferences for receiving text messages regarding heart health, research education, and study opportunities. Messaging will focus on cardiovascular health prevention, management strategies, and research processes, with the aim of fostering trust in research within the community. Pre-post surveys will be distributed to assess changes in clinical trial awareness, trust in medical research, and willingness to participate in trials at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months post-enrollment. Interaction terms will be used to evaluate differences in outcomes by race, ethnicity, and sex.\n\nThe process for matching participants to research within the CONNECT project involves individual researchers submitting requests to the CONNECT study team for access to the learning community as a recruitment resource, followed by approval Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval. Upon access, researchers can retrieve, and view records of participants matched to respective studies, ensuring access only to data pertinent to the research objectives. Verification of IRB approval is mandated, and the CONNECT study team will request documentation from the individual research team's IRB to confirm compliance before granting access. Researchers using CONNECT must document eligibility and enrollment data for each CONNECT participant matched to the participants study. Proportions of participants matched to and enrolled in ongoing research studies will be tabulated and compared across demographic groups."

          "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to see if diabetes in pregnancy can be treated with once daily dosing of insulin instead of once daily dosing plus insulin with meals. The main question this study aims to answer is:\n\n1. Can a once daily dose of long-acting insulin control blood sugars as well as long-acting insulin plus meal-time insulin?\n2. Do babies born to mothers who take one dose of long-acting insulin have more complications after birth than babies born to mothers who take long-acting and meal-time insulin? Researchers will compare one dose of long-acting insulin per day to this plus three doses of short-acting insulin with each meal to see if blood sugars are controlled.\n\nParticipants will send their blood sugar logs to the study staff weekly, instead of to their OB/GYN, for adjustments to their insulin dosing.",
          "detailedDescription": "Purpose/Specific Aims\n\nThe purpose of this study is to determine if a single dose of long-acting insulin is non-inferior to long-acting insulin plus prandial insulin to manage diabetes in pregnancy, measured by a composite neonatal outcome of NICU admission, neonatal hyperglycemia, neonatal hypoglycemia, large for gestational age, shoulder dystocia, hyperbilirubinemia, stillbirth, and neonatal death.\n\nA. Objectives:\n\nThis study aims to compare neonatal outcomes of patients with diabetes in pregnancy to determine if a single dose of long-acting insulin is non-inferior to long-acting insulin plus prandial insulin.\n\nB. Hypotheses / Research Question(s):\n\nThe hypothesis is that once-daily long-acting insulin glargine is noninferior to long-acting insulin glargine in combination with prandial short-acting insulin lispro, which is the current standard of care at our institution, for glycemic management of gestational diabetes mellitus and type 2 diabetes mellitus in pregnancy, as measured by a composite neonatal outcome. The composite outcome includes NICU admission, neonatal hyperglycemia, neonatal hypoglycemia, large for gestational age, shoulder dystocia, hyperbilirubinemia stillbirth, and neonatal death, which are associated with inadequate glycemic management during pregnancy.\n\nResearch Procedure:\n\nIndividuals will be recruited for the study during routine prenatal care visits or during initial, standard of care consults with Robert Wood Johnson Maternal Fetal Medicine Specialists when insulin use is suggested for glycemic management. Gestational age at enrollment will vary from patient to patient, but all patients will be enrolled when insulin is clinically indicated to manage their diabetes. If patients choose to participate in the study, they will be randomized to standard of care (long-acting insulin glargine plus prandial insulin lispro) or the experimental group (long-acting insulin glargine only). This study is a noninferiority study between standard of care dosing strategies. This question is best investigated via a noninferiority design, given the potential to improve the currently accepted treatment by reducing patient burden. During this initial consult, a review of medical records is completed, regardless of study participation.\n\nAfter randomization, both groups will receive dosing instructions per the Insulin Dosing Algorithm. The study utilizes a similar process to the MFM clinical workflow. Patients test their blood glucose at home, and send their blood glucose logs to MFM nurse or study team member, which includes an MFM fellow. If insulin dose adjustments are needed due to hyper- or hypoglycemia, these dose modifications will be made based off the Insulin Dosing Algorithm (Figure 1), and be recorded in the Insulin Dosing Log and communicated with the patients.\n\nPatients will remain in their randomized group unless participation in the experimental group with insulin glargine alone is not sufficient to achieve glycemic targets, as evidenced by three dose increases with persistent hyperglycemia. In that case, patients revert to standard of care group but remain in the study.\n\nThe final study procedure is data abstraction and survey administration following childbirth. The Delivery Outcomes form on REDCap will be utilized to abstract relevant maternal and neonatal outcomes from the labor and delivery hospitalization, as well as any hospitalizations indicative of maternal complications prior to childbirth. Finally, the Diabetes Treatment and Satisfaction Questionnaire - Status (DTSQs) will be administered around the time of delivery, optimally at 38 weeks gestation to assess differences in perspective based on frequency of insulin injection between the two groups. This survey has been well-validated for assessing patient satisfaction with insulin treatment. Importantly, the DTSQs is appropriately sensitive to detect changes based on this study's independent variable, as it has been used in a similar study to analyze satisfaction changes in standard insulin versus analogue insulins, as well as changes in long-term and short-term insulin. Study participation ends with the completion of the DTSQs."

          "briefSummary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to test if a regulation of craving training intervention in the form of a mobile phone app can increase fruit and vegetable intake in adolescent girls ages 14-18 years of age. The main questions it aims to answer are:\n\n1. What is the effect of a mobile app version of the regulation of craving training intervention on healthy eating index scores over one year?\n2. What is the effect of a mobile app version of the regulation of craving training intervention on body mass index, waist circumference, and blood glucose over one year? Researchers will compare the active regulation of craving training arm to a control fun food fact arm to see if the regulation of craving training improves HEI scores, BMI, and blood glucose over a year. Participants will be asked to play the regulation of craving training mobile app twice a week for a year.",
          "detailedDescription": "Randomization: Participants will be randomized to either an active mROC-T group (mROC-T+ or mROC-Tc) or a craving rating only (CRO) control group stratified by race/ethnicity and BMI%. We will use urn randomization for participant assignment.\n\nBaseline and 1-year follow up in-person visit measures Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT): We will use a standard NHANES oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) to assess the participants' glucose disposal. Participants will be fasted for at least eight hours. A fasted blood draw will be performed via finger stick. We will analyze glucose concentration using the HemoCue Glucose 201 analyzer and HbA1c using Abbott Afinion™ HbA1c analyzer. The participants will then drink a glucose bolus dosed at 1.75g glucose/kg body weight. Subsequent samples will be taken at 30, 60, 90, and 120-minutes. During which time the participant will play the mROC-T game and record their diet recall of the previous day. Participants will complete the puberty development scale (PDS), which has shown good epidemiological validity and is a suitable control variable. We will also measure height, weight, waist circumference using NHANES protocols. We will measure trait food craving using the Food Craving Questionnaire (trait).\n\nOverall model for aims 1 and 2: For both aims we will use mixed-effect models (MEM, allows us to model random intercepts for participants by location and random slopes for the intervention by time) and estimated marginal means (EMM, corrects for potential imbalanced data). Covariates (COV) are baseline PDS, FCQT, race/ethnicity, and age. Intervention is a categorical variable representing intervention group.\n\nAim1 assesses the effect of the intervention over 1 year compared to baseline in the mROC-T and CRO groups on HEI calculated monthly. Fixed effects will be considered significant at p≤ 0.02. HEI1-year \\~ Intervention\\*x(time) + HEIbaseline + COV; where x() is the time function (see note below)\n\nTime note: we plan on modeling time using linear, power polynomials (square and cubic), and logistic functions. We will compare the different time powered models using ANOVAs and consider p ≤ 0.05 a significant difference between models, and Akaike information criterion (AIC) to assess model parsimony.\n\nAim 1 expected results: Based on a 6% increase in HEI after a similar 3-month intervention, we hypothesize a clinically meaningful 10% increase in HEI after 1 year in the mROC-T groups regardless of valance, and thus a 6% reduction in T2D risk. Dr. Kober has not seen a difference between the positive or negative mROC-T conditions on eating behavior, therefore we do not expect a difference.\n\nAim2 assesses the effect of the mROC-T and CRO intervention over 1 year on change in anthropometric (BMI%, BMIz, WC) and HbA1c measures in participants (n=40) with overweight or obesity (BMI% \\> 85th) and compares them to recommended weight participants matched for age, race/ethnicity, and PDS (n=40).\n\nAbsolute change in Outcome1-year \\~ Intervention\\* BMI group(baseline) + Outcomebaseline + COV; where Outcome is BMI%, BMIz, WC, or HbA1c; COV includes baseline BMI%, WC, and/or HbA1c if not the outcome\n\nAim 2 Expected Results: We hypothesize a 0.25 reduction in BMIz (about a 2% decrease in BMI%) and a 3% decrease in WC in the intervention group only. A decrease of 0.25 BMIz is related to improved insulin sensitivity in adolescents. Given the expected improvement in HEI and BMIz associated with improved insulin sensitivity/lower T2D risk we hypothesize a clinically meaningful reduction in HbA1c of 0.5%.\n\nExploratory analysis: We will also use the model from aim 2 to explore glucose AUC and 1-hr glucose value. We will test the effect of the intervention on glucose curves using binary logistic regression."

Poorly controlled diabetes has been associated with very large babies, congenital heart defects, stillbirth, birth trauma, and maternal infections among other complications. Patients with diabetes in pregnancy require more frequent prenatal visits and fetal evaluation, and must shoulder the burden of mastering management of a complicated care regimen. With the ever-expanding world of technology, more healthcare practices are using cell phones, texting, and social media to interact with patients. Use of this technology has been successful in management of chronic diseases and as reminder systems. The investigators propose a randomized clinical trial to investigate patient adherence to recommended care regimen after intervention of a text message reminder and education system.",
          "detailedDescription": "As a part of routine care, pregnant women without known diabetes undergo screening and testing for gestational diabetes either with a two-hour glucose tolerance testing or a one-hour glucose challenge test followed by a three-hour glucose tolerance test in the event of failure of the one-hour test.\n\nWomen who have been given the diagnosis of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) by failing this diabetes testing and who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria shall be approached and offered enrollment in the study. Women with known type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) (pre-gestational diabetes) and women diagnosed elsewhere with GDM who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be offered enrollment when they establish prenatal care. Patients who consent to participate in the study shall be randomized to either the intervention or the contact control group. For randomization purposes, an equal number of notecards will be made for the two groups. These will all be placed in sealed envelopes and shuffled. At the time of patient inclusion, an envelope will be selected by the consenting practitioner. If a patient declines receiving text messages but consents to have her medical record reviewed for adherence to her diabetes care regimen and glycemic control, she will be enrolled in the standard of care control group. A baseline hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) is obtained.\n\nPatients in all groups shall receive initial diabetes education and started on an individualized diabetic diet regimen. Patients with GDM who develop a requirement for either oral medication or insulin will remain in the same group to which they were initially randomized. An HbA1c level is obtained every one to three months during pregnancy as well as near the time of delivery.\n\nPatients in the intervention group will receive reminders based on their individual disease treatment. A text message shall be sent one day (12 to 36 hours) before appointments to remind about the appointment and with instructions to bring glucose and food records to the appointment. If medication changes are made at the appointment, the patient will receive a text message reminder the day after her appointment to reinforce the regimen. Postpartum patients who had GDM will receive a text message reminder to complete their glucose tolerance test. A reminder will be sent at 2 weeks postpartum followed by a reminder at 6 weeks and 10 weeks postpartum if the testing is not completed. Women with T2DM will be reminded to bring glucose and food records to their postpartum visits. Participants will be contacted through Google Voice which is a Google system requiring a secure login and password.\n\nPatients in the contact control group will be enrolled in the text4baby program with assistance from a healthcare provider. As the study will conclude upon the patient's postpartum visit, she will be offered the option of discontinuing messages, which otherwise would continue through the infant's first year of life.\n\nHospitalizations Patient hospitalization for diabetic control shall be recorded for data collection. Patients in the intervention group will not be contacted during their hospitalization. If medicine adjustments are made during their hospitalization, a reminder text message with the new regimen shall be sent the day after discharge. Contact will then resume by the above stated schedule. If a patient is hospitalized temporarily for a reason other than diabetes, contact will resume upon discharge. If the patient is hospitalized for the remainder of the pregnancy, the patient will be removed from the study. Triage visits will not be followed.\n\nDelivery Delivery details will be abstracted from patient charts and shall include gestational age at delivery, fetal weight, vaginal versus cesarean delivery, incidence of shoulder dystocia, APGAR scores, and umbilical cord blood gases. The newborn chart shall be reviewed for the number of days spent in the neonatal intensive care unit, incidence of hypoglycemia and whether IV dextrose was required, and need for ventilator support or surfactant administration.\n\nMaternal Complications Incidence of postpartum wound infections or dehiscence shall be collected.\n\nPostpartum The postpartum glucose tolerance tests of women who had GDM will be reviewed to determine her glucose tolerance status.\n\nQuestionnaires/Surveys The participating patients will be asked to complete a survey upon entry into the study to identify barriers to their healthcare and their baseline knowledge of diabetes. A survey at the completion of their study (the postpartum visit or later) will be requested to evaluate patient perspectives on the study, their pregnancy and any perceived benefit from participation. The postpartum survey will be either completed at a postpartum visit, mailed to subjects, completed on line or subjects will be contacted by phone to complete the survey. If subjects do not return for a postpartum visit or do not complete the survey at that visit, three attempts will be made to contact subject for completion of the departure survey.\n\nFor participants who did not sign a version of the consent form that allowed for completion of the departure survey over the phone or online:\n\nIf their participation is ongoing, they will be approached at one of their visits and asked to review and sign an updated version of the consent form.\n\nFor subjects who have completed the pregnancy portion of their participation in the study but who did not complete a departure survey:\n\nSubjects will be contacted over the phone to obtain permission to allow completion of this survey over the phone, by mail or online. A phone script will be used to contact patients. If subjects cannot be reached by phone, a letter will be sent to their home address. A maximum of three phone attempts will be made to contact subject."

          "briefSummary": "Cardiometabolic risk in patients with abdominal obesity and type 1 diabetes can be moderated by life style modifications. There is an intimate link between gene regulation and circadian rhythm in mediating response to exercise in a variety of insulin sensitive organs.\n\nThe aim of this project is to evaluate, by intervention, the interplay of circadian rhythm and high intensity interval training (HIIT) on glucose control and skeletal muscle metabolism in patients with overweight with or without type 1 diabetes (T1D).",
          "detailedDescription": "High intensity interval training (HIIT) is a promising intervention for lifestyle treatment in type 1 diabetes. In spite of the interplay between circadian rhythms and exercise, the time of day in which the most robust adaption to HIIT can be achieved is unknown. The main goal of the study is to compare the efficacy of morning and afternoon HIIT in regulating blood glucose values in participants with type 1 diabetes and overweigt and to compare the effect in overweight but otherwise healthy subjects. Additionally, the investigators aim to to elucidate the metabolomics in the different settings. Healthy controls will be used to compare whether the effect of HIIT and interplay with circadian rhythm on organ metabolism is impaired in patients with T1D.\n\nA randomized cross-over trial with 25 participants with type 1 diabetes and 25 control subjects will be performed. The participants will be examined on three occasions on an out-patient basis . Visit 1 aim to run baseline measurements and a bicycle test to define maximum exertion . On visit 2 the participants will perform a single bout of HIIT (6 1-minute pulses at maximal exertion, interspersed with 1-minute recovery) either in the morning (09.00) or afternoon (16.00). After a 1-week washout period, the participants will return for visit 3 and an opposing exercise time. Primarily, the efficacy of the morning and afternoon HIIT will be judged by the continuous glucose monitor (CGM) -based glycaemia measurements. Additionally, during the visits the investigators will collect repeated blood samples to assess the effect of exercise timing on the diurnal hormonal rhythms. Muscle biopsies will be collected before and directly after HIIT.\n\nThe hypothesis is that afternoon HIIT will be more efficacious in controlling blood glucose based on the preliminary data gathered from a 'free living' pilot study in type 2 diabetes. The current study will aim to compare the morning and afternoon exercise in controlled conditions, eliminating the effects of dietary intake, medication and sleep cycle disruption. Additionally, the tissue factors responsible for the differing glycaemic response to morning and afternoon exercise will be elucidated."

          "briefSummary": "AZD9550, previously being developed for the treatment NASH, is a dual GCG and GLP-1 receptor agonist. AZD9550 is now being developed in combination with AZD6234, a SARA, for the treatment of overweight and obesity and its associated co-morbidities. Co-administration of AZD9550 and AZD6234 is currently being evaluated in participants living with obesity and overweight without T2DM in an ongoing Phase 2b study.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to investigate the safety, tolerability, and effects of increasing doses of AZD9550 monotherapy in overweight and obese participants aged 18 through 65 years living with or without T2DM, and to investigate how AZD9550 is absorbed, distributed, and eliminated from the body (Parts A-D).\n\nIn addition, the study will investigate the safety and tolerability of co-administration of AZD9550 and AZD6234 in participants living with T2DM with obesity or overweight aged 18 through 75 years (Part E).",
          "detailedDescription": "This Phase I/II, randomised, single-blind, placebo-controlled, MAD study will assess the safety and tolerability of AZD9550 monotherapy and co-administration of AZD9550 and AZD6234 and will characterise the PK and PD of AZD9550 monotherapy and co-administration of AZD9550 and AZD6234 following SC administration to overweight and obese participants living with or without T2DM. Inclusion of participants receiving placebo is appropriate for benchmarking the safety and tolerability of AZD9550 and co-administration of AZD9550 and AZD6234. A randomised and single-blind study design has been chosen to minimise bias and includes a placebo to facilitate identification of effects related to the administration of the study intervention rather than the study procedures or situation."
